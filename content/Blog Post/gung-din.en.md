*Gunga Din* is a poem by Rudyard Kipling which recounts the experience of a British soldier in colonial India, specifically with the Indians who worked for them as water-carriers.

I discovered this poem recently via the Jim Croce song, "The Ballad of Gunga Din" which sets the poem to a British-style folk ballad.  I only looked further into the origins when I heard the line about "serving for her majesty the Queen", and so I figured it must not be an American folk tune.

Here, I will present an annotated version of the poem, in which we briefly review each of the colonial British military slang that has lost its context in modern English.

First, we present the poem in its entirety:

*Gunga Din* -- Rudyard Kipling

>You may talk o’ gin and beer  
>When you’re quartered safe out ’ere,  
>An’ you’re sent to penny-fights an’ Aldershot it;  
>But when it comes to slaughter  
>You will do your work on water,  
>An’ you’ll lick the bloomin’ boots of ’im that’s got it.  
>Now in Injia’s sunny clime,  
>Where I used to spend my time  
>A-servin’ of ’Er Majesty the Queen,  
>Of all them blackfaced crew  
>The finest man I knew  
>Was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din,  
>He was ‘Din! Din! Din!  
>‘You limpin’ lump o’ brick-dust, Gunga Din!  
>‘Hi! Slippy hitherao  
>‘Water, get it! Panee lao,  
>‘You squidgy-nosed old idol, Gunga Din.’  
>  
>The uniform ’e wore  
>Was nothin’ much before,  
>An’ rather less than ’arf o’ that be’ind,  
>For a piece o’ twisty rag  
>An’ a goatskin water-bag  
>Was all the field-equipment ’e could find.  
>When the sweatin’ troop-train lay  
>In a sidin’ through the day,  
>Where the ’eat would make your bloomin’ eyebrows crawl,  
>We shouted ‘Harry By!’  
>Till our throats were bricky-dry,  
>Then we wopped ’im ’cause ’e couldn’t serve us all.  
>It was ‘Din! Din! Din!  
>‘You ’eathen, where the mischief ’ave you been?  
>‘You put some juldee in it  
>‘Or I’ll marrow you this minute  
>‘If you don’t fill up my helmet, Gunga Din!’  
>  
>’E would dot an’ carry one  
>Till the longest day was done;  
>An’ ’e didn’t seem to know the use o’ fear.  
>If we charged or broke or cut,  
>You could bet your bloomin’ nut,  
>’E’d be waitin’ fifty paces right flank rear.  
>With ’is mussick on ’is back,  
>’E would skip with our attack,  
>An’ watch us till the bugles made 'Retire,’  
>An’ for all ’is dirty ’ide  
>’E was white, clear white, inside  
>When ’e went to tend the wounded under fire!  
>It was ‘Din! Din! Din!’  
>With the bullets kickin’ dust-spots on the green.  
>When the cartridges ran out,  
>You could hear the front-ranks shout,  
>‘Hi! ammunition-mules an' Gunga Din!’  
>  
>I shan’t forgit the night  
>When I dropped be’ind the fight  
>With a bullet where my belt-plate should ’a’ been.  
>I was chokin’ mad with thirst,  
>An’ the man that spied me first  
>Was our good old grinnin’, gruntin’ Gunga Din.  
>’E lifted up my ’ead,  
>An’ he plugged me where I bled,  
>An’ ’e guv me ’arf-a-pint o’ water green.  
>It was crawlin’ and it stunk,  
>But of all the drinks I’ve drunk,  
>I’m gratefullest to one from Gunga Din.  
>It was 'Din! Din! Din!  
>‘’Ere’s a beggar with a bullet through ’is spleen;  
>‘’E's chawin’ up the ground,  
>‘An’ ’e’s kickin’ all around:  
>‘For Gawd’s sake git the water, Gunga Din!’  
>  
>’E carried me away  
>To where a dooli lay,  
>An’ a bullet come an’ drilled the beggar clean.  
>’E put me safe inside,  
>An’ just before ’e died,  
>'I ’ope you liked your drink,’ sez Gunga Din.  
>So I’ll meet ’im later on  
>At the place where ’e is gone—  
>Where it’s always double drill and no canteen.  
>’E’ll be squattin’ on the coals  
>Givin’ drink to poor damned souls,  
>An’ I’ll get a swig in hell from Gunga Din!  
>Yes, Din! Din! Din!  
>You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!  
>Though I’ve belted you and flayed you,  
>By the livin’ Gawd that made you,  
>You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din!

Let us begin.  It's sometime in the late 1800s, and British "Crown" rule in India has been in place since 1858, and would continue until India's independance in 1947.  Kipling himself was born in British India in 1865, travelling between India, England, and the United States during the span of his writing career.  *Gunga Din* was published first in the *Scots Observer* in 1890, and a few years later as part of Kipling's *Barrack-Room Ballads and Other Verses*, which was his first collection of poems and songs pertaining to the late-Victorian British army.

While Kipling himself never served in the military, he is commonly described as a "staunch imperialist" and was politically engaged in Unionist efforts and expansion of military capabilities in the years preceeding the Great War.

>You may talk o’ gin and beer  
>When you’re quartered safe out ’ere,  
>An’ you’re sent to penny-fights an’ Aldershot it;  

Aldershot is a town in Hampshire, England, home of the first permanent training camp British Army, which was established during the Crimean War in 1854.  A "penny-fight", then, we could guess is a training skirmish at the camp, where there was a prize of a penny for winning, or the spectateurs would pay a penny to watch.

>An’ you’ll lick the bloomin’ boots of ’im that’s got it.  

The adjective "bloomin'" appears a few times in this poem, but has fallen out of favor in modern English.  It's meaning is quite obvious from context as just an emphatic modifier.  In fact, "blooming" serves as a euphemism for "bloody", as the latter word was connoted as incredibly vulgar in 19th century Britain, and was heavily tabooed in print.

>Of all them blackfaced crew  
>The finest man I knew  
>Was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din,  

The Bhishti are a Muslim tribe (or "biradari") from North India.  Though the literal translation is "heavenly one" from Persian, and this was the colloquial term for the Indians serving as water-carriers to the British troops stationed in India.


>‘Hi! Slippy hitherao  
>‘Water, get it! Panee lao,  
>‘You squidgy-nosed old idol, Gunga Din.’  

"hitherao" is a Hindi expression meaning "come here", and "Panee lao," also from Hindi, means "bring water, asap".  These are surely distorted in the transcription to vernacular british from the original Hindi phrases.
