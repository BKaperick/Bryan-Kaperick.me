There is a lot of confusion around alcohol consumption, absorption, and metabolism which can contribute to the development of bad habits around alcohol, and put ourselves and others at risk by misunderstanding the regimes in which it is "safe" to perform activities such as driving after consuming alcohol.

# Units and Notation

There are several quantities of interest in the following discussion, as well as several units for each quantity which are standards in different regions or contexts. Additionally, several quantities can be derived from each other, so it is again a matter of region and context which quantity is preferred. 

For our discussion we will try to stay to the quantities and units that are recognized in the United States, or in scientific literature when discussing articles.  We will explicitly perform all necessary translations between quantities and units that are needed for unifying the discussed results.

* alcoholic beverage volume
    - standard drink
    - pint
    - US pint
* ethanol mass / liquid volume
* ethanol volume / liquid volume
* % ABV - Percentage of alcohol by volume 
* proof = 2 ABV
* pint = 500 mL

Lastly, throughout this article "ethanol" and "alcohol" will be used equivalently, though "alcohol" will be preferred in the discussion of *consumption*, while "ethanol" will be preferred in the discussion of *absorption* and *metabolism*.

# Consumption
ABV, or *alcohol by volume* is usually given as a percentage of the volume of alcohol present in a drink. One method for determining this is with a hydrometer, which is buoy with a weight calibrated to determine the density of a liquid by measuring how far the device sinks when submerged. Comparing the density before and after fermentation reveals a differential as the yeast converts sugar into alcohol and CO2 [1].

In the US, this is the quantity required by law to be listed on every beverage sold which exceeds 0.5% ABV.  For a pint of beer, each % ABV is then equivalent to 5 mL of pure ethanol in the drink.

# Absorption
# Metabolism

By "metabolism of alcohol", we are specifically describing the different mechanisms available in the human body to break down ethanol 



acetaldehyde dehydrogenase
 
Unlike many drugs, alcohol has a steady state metabolism rather than exponential decay[2].  A "zero Order Reaction"

> The reason why alcohol has a steady state metabolism rather than a half-life metabolism is because the primary decay product of alcohol metabolism--acetaldehyde--is poisonous. The body must eliminate the acetaldehyde produced by the breakdown of alcohol before any more alcohol can be processed in order to avoid acetaldehyde poisoning. This slows down the rate of alcohol metabolism to a Zero Order Reaction rather than a First Order Reaction.

Interestingly, the drug Antabuse works by binding to acetaldehyde and preventing it from breaking down, so it accumulates during metabolism of alcohol and makes you quite sick.

Rate of metabolism can be affected by multiple genetic and lifestyle factors.  Frequent drinkers produce more alcohol dehydrogenase, and thus can metabolise up to 38 mL per hour (2 standard drinks' worth) compared to the average 13 mL (0.7 standard drinks' worth).

    - Fluid is largely regulated through passive diffusion following the concentration gradients of osmotically active solutes; however, hydrostatic pressures can influence fluid movement between spaces.
    - Physiologic blood plasma osmolarity is approximately 286 mOsmoles/L. Less than this is hypoosmotic, and greater is hyperosmotic. Cellular osmotic concentration gradients are maintained largely through the active pumping of transmembrane ionic transport proteins.
    - Fluid will move towards hyperosmotic compartments and away from hypoosmotic compartments.
