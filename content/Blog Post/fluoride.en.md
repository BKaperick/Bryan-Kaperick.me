# Basics
CDC[0]: Flouride is a mineral occurring naturally from rocks/soil into the water.




# History
* 1930s noticed correlation between tooth decay in kids and drinking water natural levels of flouride.
* 1945 - Grand Rapids, Michigan starts adding fluoride to city water system.  "community water fluoridation."
* 1960s saw fluorides in toothpastes.
* Between 1965-85, Switzerland, Hungary and Colombia proved adding fluroide to alimentary salt was just as effecive as drinking water fluoridation.[4]
* "Largest medical intervention in history" is not necessarily true.  A counterpoint may be enriched flour in the US, or iodized salt. [6] may have a good summary of this.  

## Mandatory fortification/Enrichment in the US and Canada

# International 
* Most parts of the world, food is the primary source of fluoride intake (fish products with bones, tea e.g. "brick tea" in much of Asia) [3]
* In 2016, 73% of US had access to fluoridated water. (~200 million).  According to the WHO in 2003, there were only 210 million people with access to fluorified water.  This suggests that it's practically only the US who is doing this?
* See [5] for a map of fluoridated water in 2012, including both natural and artificial sources.

# Science
* All naturally occurring water contains flouride.  Concentration varies by source.
* bacteria in mouth produce acid when you eat sugar, and the acid deteriorates the minerals on the tooth's surface (enamel?).
* According to [1] it is the most cost-effective method of delivering fluoride, reducing tooth decay by 25%.
* 0,5 mg/L - 1,5 mg/L is the range of utility to achieve prevention.  Beyond here, there is  some risk, and beyond 3 mg/L you're at risk of long term "bone flourosis".
* Note: [3] says 0,5 - 1,0 mg/L is the optimal concentration.
* 2mg/day is the target, while 10mg/day will start to cause more problems.

## Controversy
* 

 
# France
* Not added by the municipality.  It is only regulated to ensure it does not surpass a maximum of 1,5 mg/L.
* Added in sel de cuisine, lait, mais pas dan des eaux d'alimentation, qui n'est pas autorisée en France.
* In 2006, 95,5% of water distributed in France was < 0,5 mg/L. [2]


# Questions / Outline
* Is there a different scientific consensus between France and the US ?  Or is it purely political/cultural ?  In either case, what historical or cultural factors could explain the difference?
* Are there measurable differences in outcome that could be a result of this difference?
* Who is the bigger outlier?  France or USA?

# Introduction
For a millenial or Gen-Z-an, the Covid-19 pandemic was perhaps the first time we thought deeply about national and global scale public health interventions.  When experienced in real-time, we saw how quickly each move was scrutinized and politicized, from the most innocuous of measures like masking, to the more extreme ones such as lockdowns.  This was not the first time in human history that liberal democracies have imposed regulations which are intended to improve public health.  In one sense, we can reflect on the 20th century as an era marred by repeated failure of political institutions through the Great Depression, two world wars, and the near-apocalyptic Cold War.  Yet throughout these challenges, a course of technological optimism was present, where it may have felt like humanity was at a turning point of abundance, having conquered the basic needs of survival and launched into an era of surplus and wonder.
