A lone, lost seagull drapes his tattered wings
that knackered bird he flaps and flaps again.
the first and finest, crispest light he brings
to drones who know not who they are nor when.

That crooked white crow croaks his final calls
As those twisted up in shame begin to play
where condensated liqueor fogs the walls--
So fall the stars that never see the day.

The gull is trapped in Johnny's 'briny deeps'
While seeking scents that drift on calmer sea,
to flutter far from all the night-stale creeps,
from land where neither beast nor man is free.


 --

Yearns the gull for Johnny's 'briny deeps'
A stench beknownst to only him and me
He seeks to flutter far from night-stale creeps,
and land where neither beast nor man is free.
