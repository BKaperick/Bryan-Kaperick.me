A lone, lost seagull drapes his tattered wings;
that knackered bird he flaps and flaps again.
The first and finest, crispest light he brings
to drones who know not who they are nor when.

The crooked, white crow he croaks his final calls
As those twisted up in shame begin to fray
where condensated liqueor fogs the walls--
so fall the stars that never see the day.

The gull now swamped in Johnny's *briny deeps*
still dreams of scents that drift on calmer seas,
to flutter far from all the night-stale creeps,
from land where neither beast nor man is free.
