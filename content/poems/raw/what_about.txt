Talk to me as you walk around love.
Sweet love.  Garlicky
nostalgia love.  Bitter gunboat
compromise love.  Lost in watery
soupy love.  It's all there in you
love.  Every ingredient a key
to sing a stream into a river,
to sing a lake into a sea,
to talk down your desires 
and fold them into me.  

And if 
we stepped together, stomped 
on flower beds
and let the crumpled petals 
dissipate in drops of dew,
would it break our stride to feel
the sun who dries
the salty streaks of dew
We find each morn'
beneath our eyes?
