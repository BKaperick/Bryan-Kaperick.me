I’d like to cross your path from time to time
To say ‘Hello’ and then ‘Goodbye’
And leave a little tune behind
— That once we knew by heart
Now worn with time —
To hum that song of ours.

Oh, hum that song of ours
Remind me how it goes, I’ve lost the rhyme.
While some day soon or far
You’ll sing a song I’ve never heard before
It’ll drive me mad, convinced I know the words
And how it ends, from hook to final verse.

But if that soon or far appears
Tomorrow or Today
Not sure how read’ly I’d admit
Your verse with him struck something new
And better than the one we wrote
Just for me and you.
