Obsessively revising
Self-consuming second guessing
Seeking sense in something
set aflame by sorry selfish me.

Hiving scared hungover
from a hopeless couple months
of perfect idleness I passed beneath
your gentle glowing grange.

And once again I wash in vain
to free my will from moping
Meaning while I wait Iâ€™m anxiously aware
that every waking moment means
the more and more you drift away from me.
