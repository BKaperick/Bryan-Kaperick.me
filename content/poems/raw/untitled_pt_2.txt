and the end it was so brief half an hour in the park and we didnt even break open the pulco and sparkling water

she was calm as was i there was maybe a single moment where a tear was held back

oh isnt it complicated to close the book of belle hectic mornings and pale razorburnt legs out in the world lovely lovely and probably crying brutally alone in her bed as i write this

sleep will come easier as i read it back each night knowing with each recitation ill fade further onto her horizon.
