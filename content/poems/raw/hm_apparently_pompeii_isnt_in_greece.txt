It’s New Year’s Eve on Mount Vesuvius
Eruption warnings are dubious
Togas loose, libations plenty
The dance floor rumbles our favorite melody
We brink dance to Old Hades' cry
Who beckons us to chase our high
His cavelings squirm through cracks to join us
Sweet smoke consumes our rowdy chorus
And so we played as spirits fused
Unified, with stamina imbued
We’ll party on ‘til liquid rock arrives
‘Til ash and friends should come alive…

…With might was dawn’s great geyser freed
At that, our wine-dark punch bowl emptied
Thus could raise one goblet all
So that our tombstones may stand tall.
