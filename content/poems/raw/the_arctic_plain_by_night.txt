Frozen was this place.
Upon it placed a placid slate
of ice.  Its might slighted
only by the wooden flame's reach.
Heat-stained beech
sunken in a pool. Stone breached.
Its presence slowly traced.
Flickers glowed, and fore-elements effaced.

A bear born in such barren land,
fur matted under the harsh cold,
carried further on by
the wailing wind's sail.
This creature comprehends
from deep within.
Ancestral knots never untied,
pulled ever tighter and petrified.

Fur flakked with mud, dirty 
and damp, absorbs the savory 
smoke to a saturated choke
and evokes streams
of warm steam stacks to
rise enveloped in empty howls.
They dance intertwined
whispering up unto the divine.

In between yawns and
howls he gnaws at his prey.
Raw flesh that lends an ache
to his jaw bone,
strained near break. All
to sustain another hunt 
between long, lonesome flights 
along the arctic plain by night.
