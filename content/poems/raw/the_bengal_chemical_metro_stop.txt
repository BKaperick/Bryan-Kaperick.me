A fine and eager Kolkata crowd lined up
at the Bengal Chemical metro stop.
Breathing heated air, their lungs would swell
with dust gumming up inside.  She tells
of that same congeal she carried all the day
from a dream that overslept, it stayed
till now since drowzy dawn before.

Its weight bore down her glassy core,
and cracked her ankle clean, the fracture snapped
and stalled the wagon's scheduled second act,
as the wheels began to slide into distress,
losing traction, gradually helpless.
Never meant to reap its fine, eager crop
at the Bengal Chemical metro stop.
