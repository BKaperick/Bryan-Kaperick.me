Her

up above the sky she climbed 
until she hung suspended,
bundled in the cloud cover 
alone but still befriended
by her audience below.

She floated on the silk mist, 
her raggedy, smirking grin,
crooked, toothy laugh and wink 
that means she's never tellin'
the day she'll fall back down.

Boys would climb on rotten trunks 
across the plains and over seas.
Leaves would fall to draw the shades, 
branches perched as front row seats
to the constellation's glow.

One dream bubble caught her look
and rose along her wispy airs
against the rain sheets pelting down 
she brought him in her flying lair
and draped him all across her lap.

He

how unequipped he was 
to lighten the grip
of those hip-sunken digits

under steady assault 
by whole hordes of 
her rain-wrinkled fingers 

lapping around and down his spine,
restlessly caressing
his numbed-over fingertips and toes.

His surrender secured, they
inaugurate the darling
of his mind's idle thoughts

and his fingers' aimless walks
guided by the keen, meaty sense
of his above-the-stars fox.
