I heard it all at the countertop:
A rubbery mix.
The pangs of soda water unspriz'd.
The clank 
        and clank 
                and clank.
Flat taps: 
    a rhythm to suscitate
all those syrupy drips unsipped.
Only fizzled-out sparks emit.
Better seal it up quick.
Lick 
    it 
        and 
            spit.
Bottle it all up,
and crank 
        and crank 
                and crank
the nozzle shut.
