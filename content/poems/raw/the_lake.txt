Dusk called you on a quest for your reflection.
Comment dire le fait de "se remettre en question" ?
Lounging at the lake brim,
the water showed an unfamiliar apparition.

You looked, in search of a placid reassurance.
He stared back with a rippling insolence,
gripping in its wickedness,
quick to erode the fangs of your innocence.

So you're swimming in the mire of your contrapart 
with anguish shining cleaner than its grime depart.
Dawn awakens you with a start,
for the spirit of the lake has replaced your heart.
