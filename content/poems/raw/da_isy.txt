Sunlight stained your bedroom walls.
You and I hid baking in the sheets.
Eyes shut, we searched
and found each otherâ€™s skin
still damp from the night.
We took turns sinking back into sleep,
fleeing our obligations to The Greats
who paved the city streets.

After noon we emerged
to face the day:
our groggy eyes opened;
your dimples glistened.
We feasted
on beauty eternal, carved into stone
and on beauty fleeting, your tender lips
wrapped around a burning cigarette.

You took your last drag.
And from the ashes,
a daisy was born,
meant only to wilt.
And so I tried
to catch each petal as it fell.
