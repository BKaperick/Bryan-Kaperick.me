As I ran by I saw you lying
limp along the sidewalk
Unforced serendipity
I didn’t watch the clock

You seemed as well as one could seem
prostrate on the floor
Peaceful even, drowned amidst
the waves of foreign shore

I wondered how you landed here
your wings a crumpled mess
A fall from sunlight’s brazen stare
onto my path ingressed

I lay my hand to light first flame
since summer’s hibernation
But you’ve cooled your gaze to stone
and cast it in the ocean
