Pinned to dusk and strung like wire
Tower the branches' fractal spires

A brass bell drones with windy pull
Dull reverberations chill the air
Birdlings dream and spiders' drool
Seeps into webs of waxen stare

Never a crack nor rust nor grime
Hours to ages pierce without remark
The lonesome architectâ€™s got time
To manufacture beauty in the dark

These streaks will soon be printed on the dawn
Where fractal spires linger on and on.
