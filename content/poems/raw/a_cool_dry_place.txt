Sitting pristine in her sleeve
plastic shrink wrapped unscratched
unplayed her ways unheard
wait to be
instead left
bought and forgot
In a cool, dry place.

Could she ever do what others do ?
Be used as lovers use ?

Cut up and torn off
clicked nicked greased up and down
soaked and dried
out spun around and flexed
And also
one day forgotten

Then they’ll do what others do,
And leave as lovers leave.

Set to dust collecting
spores or moss tossed
under another
overplayed eventually clichéd
wedged among the others
In a cool, dry place.
