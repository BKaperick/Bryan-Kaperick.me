Under sunlight setting
moth-like hid a feisty 
locksmith
on my bike 
wielding screw-driven 
might prying 
inside saddle pin lips
pursed then pressed 
open wide
mounted in the moonlight 

All while I 
none the wiser 
find her
stood up at dawn light by
my own cycle 
light one seat 
sized up and sidled off

Stolen by a slick 
brazen kiss in the night
