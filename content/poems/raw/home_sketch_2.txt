How words could be?
How they could steep.
To swim in unannounced
recounting false, rhyming memories
to all who would listen.

And some listened and sipped.
And of those, some tasted.
And of those, some lived and relived.
And at least one,
daring still past the dregs,
never made it all the way home.
