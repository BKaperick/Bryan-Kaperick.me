To travel alone and old is to
sleep upright on the subway,
subsist on Central Park dates
and hostel kitchen coffee.

To eat a hot dog nearby
and strike conversation across 
an open packet of sauerkraut.
To buy a sim card on the plane -- blind.
"Why would I need that?" 
he asks, sincerely.  "I'll take three."

Always making everyone aware 
of how pleasant they've been, 
crossing them 
on their lonely, rambling path home.
