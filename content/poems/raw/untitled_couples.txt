Bound up inside, a voice he wimpers on,
“Bring back the soft of touch that long has gone…”

What waste of blood to keep that louse around
— I’ll take my heart to firm or fertile ground.

I peer upstream to tempt the river’s way
When new soleil he shines and dawns the day.

My thrill it shimmers on the sandy cusp
Of virgin plain untouched by Sodom’s rust.

I’ll feign defense to pangs that thrust me out
Beyond the surface dissipating shroud.

With that I’ll rise above the tar that blinds
Before I’ve found the words for th’other side.
