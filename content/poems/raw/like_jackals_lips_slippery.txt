Jackal toes and bloody lips
On the wall trickles and drips
Slips then slows to a crawl
Let it all congeal.

The rabbitâ€™s jellied members
Cousins found in burnt-up embers
Whether or not they come around
That hound still shrieks.

Festered paste birthed in mildew
Rancid stir of pustules brew
We the few who slurp that liqueur
While her dusty lips moan.
