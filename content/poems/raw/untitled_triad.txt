Break my bones
                if you want to
                                I’ll wait

For them to heal before
                I call you
                                again

And when I do
                I’ll come to you
                                and crack yours too

The fractures’ll fill
                us one
                                with the other

The reluctant sheet
                can fall
                                between our feet
