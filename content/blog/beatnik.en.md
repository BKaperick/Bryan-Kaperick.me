Even in modern times, the history and origin of many words, expressions, almagamations and neologisms are only vaguely understood.  Perhaps general linguistic pathways, or cultural moments that come and then pass.  Once the dust has settled, we have a new word in our midst.  *Beatnik* is one example where we have an interesting collision of culture and politics which gives a precise understanding of a generation's monniker.

## I -- beat

Herbert Edwin Huncke left his broken family in Chicago towards a life of train-hopping vagary until he showed up in New York City at the age of 24.  You can read plenty about the so-called "Mayor of 42nd Street" and his escapades in his written works.[^1].
A life-long and self-described junkie, he fell in with the heart of the 1940s New York scene: Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and eventually Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs.  A band of unpublished hooligan writers, they eventually, well, published, and so the history goes, they make it out to San Francisco and continue the hooligantry.

For one example of Huncke's usage of *beat* in his written word, we turn to a brief essay *Ménage à Trois*.  It discuss three people living together, one being a heroin addict, and one "considerably older than the other---tired and weary to die---who sits brooding, withdrawn and confused and is no longer capable of actively maintaining his independence".  We have a brief snapshot of the deterioration of their living situation, as the younger man reflects on how "he hadn't realized how beat" the older man was.  "The guy had lost his heart and simply couldn't make it." [^1]  This is the interpretation passed on to Kerouac, although he would also go on to grow a connection to "beatific", "upbeat", and several forms of musical affiliation.  Huncke's "fatigued" sense is that which is consistently applied in Caen's column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen's usage would diverge along a different branch to imply a layer of "laziness" or "listlessness" on top of that core ennui.  A 1965 account[^4] would tell us that the *beat generation* "reflect[s] passion for jazz rather than despair at the state of the world," suggesting that Kerouac's interpretation may be the most persistent.  

This is all I have to say about *beat*.  Let's move on to *nik*.

## II -- nik

On October 4th, 1957, the US flinched as the Soviet Union succeeded in launching humanity's first satellite, Sputnik I.  American media held its breath until December 6th, where we saw a wave of *nik*-based press coverage in response to the US's Vanguard 1A failure. The flop gave way to mocking nicknames "kaputnik", "flopnik", "stayputnik", and even some more creative variations like "sputnik burger", and the most bluntly onomonaepaeic -- "sput".[^0]

A Slavic suffix, it has arrived in American English both through Russian (-ник) and Yiddish (־ניק) branches.  -nik is a suffix of membership, identifying one as a member of the preceding noun.  "Sputnik" can be translated to "traveling companion".  The "s-" indicating "fellow", or "co-", and "put" meaning "way" or "path".

For some Yiddish examples, *nudnik* (נודניק) means a "pesterer" or a "borer".  *kibbutznik* (פּליקיבוץ) is a member of a kibbutz (collective, agrarian communities in Israel), or *plimenik* (פּלימעניק) for "nephew".[^1]


## III -- beatnik
So it came to be, on April 2nd, 1958, Herb Caen reports in the San Francisco Chronicle:

> Look magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.'s beat generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles' free booze. They're only beat, y'know, when it comes to work.[^3]

Which seemed to take off immediately, likely due to Caen's immense influence on the local cultural scene.

Although Caen would later testify that he had no ill-intention with the description (see [^3] for some discussion and skepticism about this assertion), the term was perhaps inevitably associated with communism and a general American inferiority complex in the wake of *Sputnik*'s launch.  Thereafter, the suffix's further present in the American culture was in passing associations to other young nonconformists: *neatnik*, *peacenik*, *computernik*, etc.  

Since then, the Anglosphere appears to have moved on.  New generations rise, and the Soviet Union has collapsed.  The Beatniks perhaps live on somewhere (probably no longer in San Francisco), and certainly the *computerniks* are stronger than ever.
