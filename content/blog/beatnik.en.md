It is surprising, perhaps, that in the age of the always-on, always-recording internet, that the evolution of our language so often eludes precise study.  Exact origins of our daily expressions, slang, and neologisms are only vaguely understood.  General linguistic pathways, or intersections cultural moments that come and pass.  Once the dust has settled, we stand there as witnesses to our collective tongues' new child.  

The word *Beatnik* can help demonstrate that formation of new language through understanding a generation's moniker.  Moreover, it serves as an example of how that history can be messier than it may first appear.

## I -- beat

Herbert Edwin Huncke left his broken family in Chicago towards a life of train-hopping vagantry until he showed up in New York City at the age of 24.  From his arrival in 1939 onward, the so-called "Mayor of 42nd Street" departed for a life of drug-fuelled escapades, petty crime, and sexual exploration, as recounted in his written works[^1] and by his many friends.
A life-long and self-described junkie, he fell in with the heart of the 1940s New York scene: musicians like Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and eventually writers and poets: Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs.  A band of unpublished hooligan writers, they eventually, well, published, and so the history goes, they make it out to San Francisco and continue the hooligantry.  Except Huncke, he stays in New York.  There are many books and poems and songs by and about these guys and their lives.  The goal here is not to give a full biography of the movement, so let's get back to *the word*.

For one example of Huncke's usage of *beat* in his own words, we turn to a short essay (story? poem?) of his, *Ménage à Trois*.  It discuss three people living together, one being a heroin addict, and one "considerably older than the other---tired and weary to die---who sits brooding, withdrawn and confused and is no longer capable of actively maintaining his independence".  We have a brief snapshot of the deterioration of their living situation, as the younger man reflects on how "he hadn't realized how beat" the older man was.  "The guy had lost his heart and simply couldn't make it." [^1]  This is the interpretation passed on to Kerouac, although he would also go on to grow a connection to "beatific", "upbeat", and several forms of musical affiliation.  Huncke's "fatigued" sense is that which is consistently applied in Caen's column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen's usage would diverge along a different branch to imply a layer of "laziness" or "listlessness" on top of that core ennui.  A 1965 account[^4] would tell us that the *beat generation* "reflect[s] passion for jazz rather than despair at the state of the world," suggesting that Kerouac's interpretation may be the most persistent.  

Of course, Huncke was not the first person to use "beat" in this sense.  We can try to trace back even further, the full phrase "beat to the socks".  I don't have a good answer here.  Eddie Condon [And His Windy City Seven] has a song titled "Beat To The Socks" on a collection "1927-1943", and Pee Wee Russell has the same on "Weary Blues Vol 1" which appears to have been released in 1938.[^5]  There is just a *mood*, no lyrics, so this implies the expression would have been readily understood to a mixed 1930s New York City jazz crowd, so it probably dates much earlier than this.

This is all I can say about *beat*.  Let's move on to *nik*.

## II -- nik

On October 4th, 1957, the US flinched as the Soviet Union succeeded in launching humanity's first satellite, Sputnik I (Спутник-1).  American media held its breath until December 6th, where we saw a wave of *nik*-based press coverage in response to the US's Vanguard 1A failure. The flop gave way to mocking nicknames "kaputnik", "flopnik", "stayputnik", and even some more creative variations like "sputnik burger", as well as the most bluntly onomatopoeiaic -- "sput".[^6]


This is indeed the classic interpretation of *beatnik*'s *nik*, though an important competing theory is that of Yiddish-American origin.

As a Slavic suffix, it has arrived in American English both through Russian (-ник) and Yiddish (־ניק) branches.  -nik is a suffix of membership, identifying one as a member of the preceding noun.In English, it serves a similar function as *-er*.  "Sputnik" is most popularly translated as "traveling companion".  The "s-" indicating "fellow", and "put" meaning "way" or "path".  Before 1957, it was used in so-called "Yinglish" slang among Yiddish-speaking immigrants to various Western European and American countries.  
For some Yiddish examples, *nudnik* (נודניק) means a "pesterer" or a "borer".  *kibbutznik* (פּליקיבוץ) is a member of a kibbutz (collective, agrarian communities in Israel), or *plimenik* (פּלימעניק) for "nephew".[^1]  H.L. Menkins' 1919 research notes "nogoodni[c]k", "allrightnick", and allegedly "consumptionick" to mean a victim of tuberculosis[^7].  

The most successful of these crossing into mainstream English was surely "nogoodnick". It was featured in 1950's Tony-winning and Pulitzer-selected[^\*] Broadway hit *Guys and Dolls* when Frank Loesser sings in *Sue Me*, "Alright, already, I'm just a nogoodnick".  In 1955, the film adaptation would have this line immortalized by none other than Frank Sinatra[^9].

Additionally, in the March 31st, 1952 issue of Life Magazine, L'il Abner and Daisy Mae married, after 18 years of pent up comic strip sexual tension, which apparently was a big event, featuring them on the cover, and an interview with its author Al Capp.  In it, he writes about the strip's fictional country of Lower Slobbovia, ruled over by Good King Nogoodnik[^8].  Wikipedia claims L'il Abner had 60 million regular readers at its peak.

## III -- beatnik
So it came to be, on April 2nd, 1958, Herb Caen reports in the San Francisco Chronicle:

> Look magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.'s beat generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles' free booze. They're only beat, y'know, when it comes to work.[^3]

Which seemed to take off immediately, likely due to Caen's immense influence on the local cultural scene.

Although Caen would later testify that he had no ill-intention with the description (see [^3] for some discussion and skepticism about this assertion), the term was perhaps inevitably associated with communism and a general American inferiority complex in the wake of *Sputnik*'s launch.  Thereafter, the suffix's further present in the American culture was in passing associations to other young nonconformists: *neatnik*, *peacenik*, *computernik*, etc.  

Since then, the Anglosphere appears to have moved on.  New generations rise, and the Soviet Union has collapsed.  The Beatniks perhaps live on somewhere (probably no longer in San Francisco), and certainly the *computerniks* are stronger than ever.
