## Me
Hello, I'm Bryan - a 26 year old guy living in Lille, and working in Paris.  I enjoy working on
problems in computational mathematics, data engineering, and numerical analysis.  Here in
France, I enjoy walking around parks and cities, practicing my French with strangers in bars, and rock climbing.

## Books I'd like to read soon


* *Dune Messiah* -- Frank Herbert

I have to get to this before the next movie comes out.

## Books I'm currently reading
* *Death's End* -- Cixin Liu

The third of The Three Body Problem trilogy.  Though I'm reading it in French, so it's taking me some time to finish.

* *Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence* -- Bryan Burrough

I'm interested in learning more about recent American counter-cultural/protest history to help put today's movements in context.  Some interesting context around domestic terrorism in the relatively-recent past.  Given that I've lived almost my entire life in post-9/11 America, it's quite shocking the amount of shit people got away with.
