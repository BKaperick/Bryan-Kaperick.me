Certaines des passages sur cette page sont assez intime, comme c'est normal avec la poésie, donc poursuivez la lecture avec cet avertissement en tête.

En plus, la plupart de mes poèmes sont écrits en anglais, et je vais pas les traduire pour éviter de me ridiculiser encore plus que je me ridiculise en partageant mes poèmes sur mon site web publique.

Je dirais que mon style d'écriture tombe quelque part sur le spectre entre *dérivée*, et *cringe*.  Bien sur que je reste ouvert à tout genre de retour.

*People at Night* -- Rainer Maria Rilke

>Nights were not made for the crowds, and they sever  
>You from your neighbor, so you shall never  
>Seek him, defiantly, at night.  
>But if you make your dark house light,  
>To look on strangers in your room,  
>You must reflect&mdash;on whom.  
>  
>False lights that on men's faces play  
>Distort them gruesomely.  
>You look upon a disarray,  
>A world that seems to reel and sway,  
>A waving, glittering sea.  
>On their foreheads gleams a yellow shine  
>Where thoughts are chased away.  
>Their glances flicker mad from wine,  
>And to the words they say  
>Strange heavy gestures make reply,  
>That struggle in the buzzing room;  
>And they say always, "I" and "I";  
>And mean&mdash;they know not whom.  

*On First Looking into Chapman's Homer* -- John Keats

>Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,  
>And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;  
>Round many western islands have I been  
>Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.  
>Oft of one wide expanse had I been told  
>That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;  
>Yet did I never breathe its pure serene  
>Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:  
>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies  
>When a new planet swims into his ken;  
>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes  
>He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men  
>Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—  
>Silent, upon a peak in Darien.  

*Kubla Khan* -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge  
   *Or, a vision in a dream.  A Fragment.*

>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan  
>A stately pleasure-dome decree:  
>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran  
>Through caverns measureless to man  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to a sunless sea.  
>So twice five miles of fertile ground  
>With walls and towers were girdled round;  
>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,  
>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;  
>And here were forests ancient as the hills,  
>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.  
>  
>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted  
>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!  
>A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
>As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted  
>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!  
>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,  
>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,  
>A mighty fountain momently was forced:  
>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst  
>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,  
>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:  
>And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever  
>It flung up momently the sacred river.  
>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion  
>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,  
>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,  
>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;  
>And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far  
>Ancestral voices prophesying war!  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the dome of pleasure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated midway on the waves;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was heard the mingled measure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fountain and the caves.  
>It was a miracle of rare device,  
>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!  
>  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vision once I saw:  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an Abyssinian maid  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her dulcimer she played,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing of Mount Abora.  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I revive within me  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her symphony and song,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a deep delight ’twould win me,  
>That with music loud and long,  
>I would build that dome in air,  
>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!  
>And all who heard should see them there,  
>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!  
>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
>Weave a circle round him thrice,  
>And close your eyes with holy dread  
>For he on honey-dew hath fed,  
>And drunk the milk of Paradise.  

*Compliment* -- John Updike

>We were both of two minds about adultery  
>and wasted our couple of stolen hours  
>half-undressed in the Afternoon Motel  
>kissing and drinking and doubting and forgoing.  
>She had never betrayed her husband before.  
>I said, "O.K., so don't, let's not.  This has been   
>a lot of fun in any case."  
>But something inquisitive in her, in Eve,  
>would not move back from the brink,  
>and after the longest, gentlest time lying  
>side by side on the still-intact rented bed  
>(I admiring her upper lip while it twitched in well-phrased trepidation, time running out),  
>there was a surge as in a written exam  
>when the answer had suddenly come to her;  
>we completed the half left un- (see above),  
>and the shy sea-creature of her ferny pubic hair  
>gave me something else to admire, and  
>a new aroma to activate my briny deeps.  
>She was sweetly tight but not dry, not quite   
>a virgin.  "O.K.?" I asked, half guilty,  
>glancing over at her proximate profile.  
>Tremulous eyelids nervily closed upon  
>a dreaming vision of the fallen world's dooms,  
>and all the web of her sensation bent  
>to hold the pulsing bulk of this new captive,  
>she breathed the single smiling word "Terrific."

*Da isy* -- Juillet 2024

>Sunlight stained your bedroom walls.  
>You and I hid baking in the sheets.  
>Eyes shut, we searched  
>and found each other's skin  
>still damp from the night.  
>We took turns sinking back into sleep,  
>fleeing our obligations to The Greats  
>who paved the city streets.  
>  
>After noon we emerged  
>to face the day:  
>our groggy eyes opened;  
>your dimples glistened.  
>We feasted  
>on beauty eternal, carved into stone  
>and on beauty fleeting, your tender lips  
>wrapped around a burning cigarette.  
>  
>You took your last drag,  
>and from the ashes,  
>a daisy was born, but  
>meant only to wilt.  
>And so I tried  
>to catch each petal as it fell.  

*Untitled* -- Juin 2024

>Morning growls  
>While the di-named lioness  
>In exhaling betrays  
>Her thoughts hidden still  
>On that hillside crest  
>Where our fallen arms defined us  
>As the grass defined the meadow.  

*Free to float* -- Mai 2024

>If he could float from tree to tree,  
>on which clichés he'd perch?  
>Barefoot on her knife's edge,  
>or rocking the cradle to ease  
>Babe  
>back to sleep.  
>Back to dream states  
>where men, like birds,  
>are free to float from tree to tree.  

*While in decline* -- Mai 2024

>The sun still shines while in decline  
>And bees slave all their lives  
>Sea waves collapse in foamy smacks  
>And trees in hollow snaps.  
>  
>A man may choose to honey bathe  
>Or surf the lightning's strike  
>But he like all must heed the call  
>Of sunset on his back.  

*Untitled triad* -- Mai 2024

*Moroccan mist* -- Mai 2024

>Moroccan mist evaporates away  
>From all the dusty hash that filled our lungs  
>An offer Flo a coffee kind of day  
>Afloat but crooked, far from ferry's strait.  
>  
>We'd rather stop for cars and caravans  
>We waited wafting in the evening gas  
>To every city vite-fait brined in wine  
>For Tim as well who kept the rhythm's beat.  
>  
>Till Basque I surfed to take the solo lead  
>Far from the hold of Silvio's belay  
>Without a name I spun that game of chance  
>And downed those drunken sips of Leah's sweet.  

*Watch* -- Mai 2024

>Watch through the window  
>the mug that wobbles unprompted  
>wait wait and watch  
>the shards that settle among the crumbs  
>wait outside an hour  
>after the shatter settles  
>and the lowly he rises  
>to lick the spill off the tile  
>like a dog  

*Untitled* -- Avril 2024

>Puddles stain the pavement

>trampled by the tourists'  
>dampened leather shoes.  
>  
>Slouching on a concrete bench  
>sidelining the plaza,  
>he's chewing on some homesick  
>and his heart's beating blue.  

*The doghouse* -- Avril 2024

>Awakened in a troubling grime,  
>the morning crawls out of the doghouse  
>to confront its own ragged, plastic self.  
>It whinges, squeaks, shudders  
>and slumps back inside,  
>packed in with the other.  
>  
>Their mammalian hides  
>side by side - crystalline.  
>In heavy wimpers  
>one expands while the other contracts.  
>Both frightened  
>by the heightened sense that lasts  
>dew-dampened before the fall  
>of noon's eventual descent.  

*Un mardi soir* -- Mars 2024

>Du temps perdu

*The tower* -- Février 2024

>His eyes and Hers align to keep  
>panoptic, periodic rhyme at sea  
>and frothy mermen arms outreached  
>for prey who slips away beneath  
>the tower's twin-turn stare.  
>  
>Frustrated shadows lurk below

>Then one night the twin pair winked &mdash;  
>Her brother fell from tower's brink.  
>Straight He dove and straight He'll sink.  
>Sister waterlogged by weeps,  
>She cast Her duty off without a care.  
>  
>Storms arise when rhythm's lost,  
>sirens shriek like albatross,  
>long-drowned urchins shed their moss,  
>nocturne barges glide across  
>the purview of a watch in disrepair.  
>  
>By dawn Her misery ossified.  
>A corroded heart beats in half-time  
>all while shadows grow twice as wide.  
>Her mood now high and low like tide  
>ever bound to the pull of out there.  

*In the dark* -- Janvier 2024

>Pinned to dusk and strung like wire  
>Tower the branches' fractal spires  
>  
>A brass bell drones with windy pull  
>Dull reverberations chill the air  
>Birdlings dream and spiders' drool  
>Seeps into webs of waxen stare  
>  
>Never a crack nor rust nor grime  
>Hours to ages pierce without remark  
>The lonesome architect's got time  
>To manufacture beauty in the dark

*Monorhyme sketch #3* -- Décembre 2023

>Goldilocks was feeling bold,

*Ode to Sami* -- Novembre 2023

>Our man's evaporated &mdash; gone.  
>After the party rises dawn  
>A quiet, calmer house he leaves  
>Infused with that which he believes.  
>Now off to scrub ancestral mire  
>From the grounds of Imane's spire  
>For shines a hope in progeny  
>That's barely grazed by coloc-amis.  
>  
>As he ascends to the fourth floor  
>We're sewing stitches evermore  
>His scalpel sketched the lessons learned  
>Into our cheeks the stories burn  
>Red-raw from cold or rush of blood  
>At Sami's wisdom understood.

>I peer upstream to tempt the river's way  
>When new soleil he shines and dawns the day.  
>  
>My thrill it shimmers on the sandy cusp  
>Of virgin plain untouched by Sodom's rust.  
>  
>I'll feign defense to pangs that thrust me out  
>Beyond the surface dissipating shroud.

*Limp* -- Octobre 2023

*A raven's lust* -- Octobre 2023

*Untitled night* -- Février 2023

>Her animal lay wild,  
>hunched, and prowling in its cage  
>with iron bars made brittle by  
>the advance of our seduction.  
>Then one day she pounced and bared  
>&mdash; Breathing with her whole body like an organ.  
>An affront to what I used to know as "passion".  
>  
>At once the wilderness subsided  
>and we both froze then melted.  
>She stepped fully into me,  
>hesitation revealed to be  
>footprints parting in the sand  
>as evening tide approaches.  
>&mdash; Call it a kind of destiny  
>we'd read between the waves.  
>  
>So I gave myself relentlessly,  
>inspired by that ferocity  
>eager claws know well to be  
>lurking beneath the dirt.  
>And finally, when she drew blood,  
>evinced our last temptation  
>&mdash; We shared her gristle-ridden lair  
>fused together, cast in crimson.

*Kansas Sky* -- Juillet 2022

>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.  
>Once suspended in the Kansas sky  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.   
>The eye which held a twinkle last night  
>Not from a star, but a lightning strike.  
>And here I gaze at Julie next to me    
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep  

*Like jackals, lips slippery* -- Mai 2022

>Jackal toes and bloody lips  
>On the wall trickles and drips  
>Slips then slows to a crawl  
>Let it all congeal.  
>  
>The rabbit's jellied members  
>Cousins found in burnt-up embers  
>Whether or not they come around  
>That hound still shrieks. 
>  
>Festered paste birthed in mildew  
>Rancid stir of pustules brew  
>We the few who slurp that liqueur  
>While her dusty lips moan.  
 
*Fierce creature* -- Janvier 2020

>Fierce creature.  
>Her warm-armed currents  
>Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.  
>Pulsing violent,  
>Spewing caustic, emptying  
>Into basins which steam future desire,  
>Filled to quench days spent apart.
