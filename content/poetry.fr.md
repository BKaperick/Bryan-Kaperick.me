Cette page-là pourrait devenir assez personalle, comme s'est normal pour la poésie, donc entrez-vous avec cette précaution en tete.

En plus, la plupart de mes poémes seront sans doute en anglais, et je vais pas les traduire pour eviter de m'embarrasser encore plus que je m'embarrasse en partageant mes poémes sur mon site web publique.

Je classifierai mon style d'etre quelque-part sur la spectre entre *dérivée*, et *cringe*.  Bien sur, je reste ouvert à tout genre de retour.

*Kubla Khan* -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge  
   *Or, a vision in a dream.  A Fragment.*

>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan  
>A stately pleasure-dome decree:  
>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran  
>Through caverns measureless to man  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to a sunless sea.  
>So twice five miles of fertile ground  
>With walls and towers were girdled round;  
>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,  
>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;  
>And here were forests ancient as the hills,  
>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.  
>  
>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted  
>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!  
>A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
>As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted  
>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!  
>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,  
>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,  
>A mighty fountain momently was forced:  
>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst  
>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,  
>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:  
>And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever  
>It flung up momently the sacred river.  
>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion  
>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,  
>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,  
>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;  
>And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far  
>Ancestral voices prophesying war!  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the dome of pleasure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated midway on the waves;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was heard the mingled measure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fountain and the caves.  
>It was a miracle of rare device,  
>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!  
>  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vision once I saw:  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an Abyssinian maid  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her dulcimer she played,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing of Mount Abora.  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I revive within me  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her symphony and song,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a deep delight ’twould win me,  
>That with music loud and long,  
>I would build that dome in air,  
>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!  
>And all who heard should see them there,  
>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!  
>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
>Weave a circle round him thrice,  
>And close your eyes with holy dread  
>For he on honey-dew hath fed,  
>And drunk the milk of Paradise.  

*Compliment* -- John Updike

>We were both of two minds about adultery  
>and wasted our couple of stolen hours  
>half-undressed in the Afternoon Motel  
>kissing and drinking and doubting and forgoing.  
>She had never betrayed her husband before.  
>I said, "O.K., so don't, let's not.  This has been   
>a lot of fun in any case."  
>But something inquisitive in her, in Eve,  
>would not move back from the brink,  
>and after the longest, gentlest time lying  
>side by side on the still-intact rented bed  
>(I admiring her upper lip while it twitched in well-phrased trepidation, time running out),  
>there was a surge as in a written exam  
>when the answer had suddenly come to her;  
>we completed the half left un- (see above),  
>and the shy sea-creature of her ferny pubic hair  
>gave me something else to admire, and  
>a new aroma to activate my briny deeps.  
>She was sweetly tight but not dry, not quite   
>a virgin.  "O.K.?" I asked, half guilty,  
>glancing over at her proximate profile.  
>Tremulous eyelids nervily closed upon  
>a dreaming vision of the fallen world's dooms,  
>and all the web of her sensation bent  
>to hold the pulsing bulk of this new captive,  
>she breathed the single smiling word "Terrific."

*Untitled* Juillet 2023

>If ever a lonely night  
>Should you wake in a sharp tremor  
>From a passing specter's strike  
>Whose trailing vapors leak a sweet scene  
>That only you and I could recognize...  
>  
>Écrase-le !  
>Et moi je vais faire pareil  
>Il n'est rien qu'un moustique qui vit de l'obscurité  
>Un porte-souvenir des nuits si chauds  
>Et ses piqûres guériront par l'aube du lendemain  
>  
>Même si l'odeur persiste toujours  
>Cet odeur dont l'existence le matin  
>révèle que ce rêve  
>Ne vivait pas que dans ta tête  
>Ni que pendant la nuit  

*Whalebone branches* -- Juin 2023

>Whalebone branches  
>they bellow and spill  
>leaves torn from their bindings  
>onto all the stand-buyers  
>in the widening gyre.  
>  
>Those urchins from Ur  
>with their babbling burns  
>each scar submits a solution  
>"Not a 5-over-1, it's just so overdone."  
>A sober flight takes thought  
>with a rabid Star Fox  
>whose atavistic impulses  
>barrel-roll to steal the old  
>from the Niagara Cafe.  
>  
>And maybe in its depths  
>he'll ask directions  
>from the Maidens of Mist.  
>They'll turn tablets to clay  
>declare "La vie est une scie"  
>buy a round for all  
>the hypocrites of twenty twenty-three.  
>  
>Silver tongues will take a lick,  
>restore our faith in Moby Dick,  
>find ourselves like that Tarkovsky flick,  
>till no warm-blooded carcass persists.  

* Untitled * -- Mai 2023

>Accro à la banalité  
>A la recherche d'une bière  
>Tellement de temps bu  
>Sans rien faire  
>Chasseurs des pique-niques  
>Cuites au soleil  
>Brillants sommes nous  
>Les lapins d'été  

*Those oozing stacks grow* -- Avril 2023

>I want to tell of carcasses stacked tall  
>Of honey dried out at crusty summer's fall  
>That bridge appeared and beckoned passers-by  
>To give the yonder ravine's edge a try.  
>  
>So you and her, cutting through the weeds &mdash;  
>Trudged, creaking, above the misty deeps  
>In search of fire to warm your tender skin  
>or adventure's strike to bake you from within.  
>But an hour's passed and still ye edge along  
>uncertain heartbeats pound a booming song.  
>  
>All while we howl and screech out for you  
>"Oh lovelies, you've never seen splendors more true  
>than that which awaits all who cross the border  
>and abides by our master's all-knowing order"  
>Put candidly, just once, for the hatchlings to our realm  
>Take a dive, be immersed, as a feather to inkwell.  
>  
>You smirked and wrote verse, your spirits were high  
>Eager for the taverns where they'll chant your hero's cry  
>And so ye arrive, dock on our shores  
>waves hit with sting, mixing afters and befores  
>Drowning on the cliff, you hold each other tight  
>Swords drawn, side by side, ready for the fight...  
>  
>...Excuse me, dear listener,  
>I'll divulge nothing more.  
>Our master  
>would rather  
>cast shadows  
>than lore.  
>  
>I promised sick tales of flesh piled high  
>but suffice it to know  
>those oozing stacks grow  
>with each ripe passerby.  

*Untitled night* -- Février 2023

>Her animal lay wild,  
>hunched, and prowling in its cage  
>with iron bars made brittle by  
>the advance of our seduction.  
>Then one day she pounced and bared  
>&mdash; Breathing with her whole body like an organ.  
>An affront to what I used to know as "passion".  
>  
>At once the wilderness subsided  
>and we both froze then melted.  
>She stepped fully into me,  
>hesitation revealed to be  
>footprints parting in the sand  
>as evening tide approaches.  
>&mdash; Call it a kind of destiny  
>we'd read between the waves.  
>  
>So I gave myself relentlessly,  
>inspired by that ferocity  
>eager claws know well to be  
>lurking beneath the dirt.  
>And finally, when she drew blood,  
>evinced our last temptation  
>&mdash; We shared her gristle-ridden lair  
>fused together, cast in crimson.  

*Kansas Sky* -- Juillet 2022

>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.  
>Once suspended in the Kansas sky  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.   
>The eye which held a twinkle last night  
>Not from a star, but a lightning strike.  
>And here I gaze at Julie next to me    
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep  

*Untitled* -- Mai 2022

>Jackal toes and bloody lips  
>On the wall trickles and drips  
>Slips then slows to a crawl  
>Let it all congeal.  
>  
>The rabbit's jellied members  
>Cousins found in burnt-up embers  
>Whether or not they come around  
>That hound still shrieks. 
>  
>Festered paste birthed in mildew  
>Rancid stir of pustules brew  
>We the few who slurp that liqueur  
>While her dusty lips moan.  
 
*Fierce creature* -- Janvier 2020

>Fierce creature.  
>Her warm-armed currents  
>Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.  
>Pulsing violent,  
>Spewing caustic, emptying  
>Into basins which steam future desire,  
>Filled to quench days spent apart.
