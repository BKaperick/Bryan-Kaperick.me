In Japan in 2021, the *assembly, testing and packaging (The completion of the fabrication process yields a finished wafer housing numerous chips in a grid pattern. The subsequent stage is Assembly, which involves testing and packaging. The wafer undergoes division into individual chips or 'dies.' Each chip is mounted on a frame, wired to facilitate connection with external devices, and housed within a protective case. This stage results in the familiar image of a rectangular, dark grey chip with metal pins around the periphery. The chip also undergoes testing to confirm its operational capacity.

Historically, Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP) was considered a lower value stage. However, with the exponential rise in transistor densities within logic chips, packaging has progressively become a key determinant of chip performance.)* was 7
