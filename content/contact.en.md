If you want to discuss anything you've seen on this site, or you know me and want to say hi, or even if you don't know me and want to say hi, you can send me an email at bryan.kaperick@gmail.com.

For a relatively complete view of my online presence, you can check out any of the following:

* [Github](https://github.com/BKaperick), 
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryankaperick/), 
* [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snakeboy), 
* I guess [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bkapers/), [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/snake_boy), or even [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bkapers) if you really want to get in the weeds

Of course we can also coordinate to meet up in person in or around northern France or eastern US depending on the time of year.
