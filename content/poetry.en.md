This page can get rather personal, as poetry tends to be, so proceed at your own risk.

I would categorize my personal style as somewhere between *derivative* and *cringe*.  Of course, I'm open to all sorts of feedback.

# Surrender (2022--02)
>She'd already been walking for awhile  
>when I stopped by and smiled.  
>She used me like I always knew  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to be used.  
>That night I lived my mirrored words.  I knew  
>She'd give me shelter, if I surrendered.  
>
>Mutually discarded,  
>we walked some more   
>with four eyes fixed  
>on the berth of forest lying in the distance.  
>"That'll give us shelter, if we surrender."  
>
>But then we split, dawn took us in  
>and we realized a sickly thought--  
>Our pleasure dome was hollow leaves,   
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but built so beautifully.   
>I need not look beyond that figure,   
>lingering deaf and blind   
>on the horizon.  It's you.  
>You'll give me shelter, if I surrender.  

# Kansas Sky (2022--07)
>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.  
>Once suspended in the Kansas sky  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.   
>The eye which held a twinkle last night  
>Not from a star, but a lightning strike.  
>And here I gaze at Julie next to me    
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep  

# Untitled (2022--05--23)

>Jackal toes and bloody lips  
>On the wall trickles and drips  
>Slips then slows to a crawl  
>Let it all congeal.  
>  
>The rabbit's jellied members'  
>Cousins found in burnt-up embers  
>Whether or not they come around  
>That hound still shrieks. 
 
# Fierce creature (2020--01--13)

>Fierce creature.  
>Her warm-armed currents  
>Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.  
>Pulsing violent,  
>Spewing caustic, emptying  
>Into basins which steam future desire,  
>Filled to quench days spent apart.
