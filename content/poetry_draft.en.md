This page can get rather personal, as poetry tends to be, so proceed at your own risk.

I would categorize my personal style as somewhere between *derivative* and *cringe*.  Of course, I'm open to all sorts of feedback.

*Kubla Khan* -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge  
   *Or, a vision in a dream.  A Fragment.*

>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan  
>A stately pleasure-dome decree:  
>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran  
>Through caverns measureless to man  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to a sunless sea.  
>So twice five miles of fertile ground  
>With walls and towers were girdled round;  
>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,  
>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;  
>And here were forests ancient as the hills,  
>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.  
>  
>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted  
>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!  
>A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
>As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted  
>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!  
>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,  
>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,  
>A mighty fountain momently was forced:  
>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst  
>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,  
>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:  
>And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever  
>It flung up momently the sacred river.  
>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion  
>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,  
>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,  
>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;  
>And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far  
>Ancestral voices prophesying war!  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the dome of pleasure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated midway on the waves;  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was heard the mingled measure  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fountain and the caves.  
>It was a miracle of rare device,  
>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!  
>  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vision once I saw:  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an Abyssinian maid  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her dulcimer she played,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing of Mount Abora.  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I revive within me  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her symphony and song,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a deep delight ’twould win me,  
>That with music loud and long,  
>I would build that dome in air,  
>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!  
>And all who heard should see them there,  
>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!  
>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
>Weave a circle round him thrice,  
>And close your eyes with holy dread  
>For he on honey-dew hath fed,  
>And drunk the milk of Paradise.  

*Compliment* -- John Updike

>We were both of two minds about adultery  
>and wasted our couple of stolen hours  
>half-undressed in the Afternoon Motel  
>kissing and drinking and doubting and forgoing.  
>She had never betrayed her husband before.  
>I said, "O.K., so don't, let's not.  This has been   
>a lot of fun in any case."  
>But something inquisitive in her, in Eve,  
>would not move back from the brink,  
>and after the longest, gentlest time lying  
>side by side on the still-intact rented bed  
>(I admiring her upper lip while it twitched in well-phrased trepidation, time running out),  
>there was a surge as in a written exam  
>when the answer had suddenly come to her;  
>we completed the half left un- (see above),  
>and the shy sea-creature of her ferny pubic hair  
>gave me something else to admire, and  
>a new aroma to activate my briny deeps.  
>She was sweetly tight but not dry, not quite   
>a virgin.  "O.K.?" I asked, half guilty,  
>glancing over at her proximate profile.  
>Tremulous eyelids nervily closed upon  
>a dreaming vision of the fallen world's dooms,  
>and all the web of her sensation bent  
>to hold the pulsing bulk of this new captive,  
>she breathed the single smiling word "Terrific."

*Surrender* -- February 2023

>She'd already been walking for awhile  
>when I stopped by and smiled  
>She used me like I always knew  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to be used.  
>That night I lived my mirrored words.  
>I knew she'd give me shelter, so I abided.  
> 
>Mutually discarded,  
>we walked some more  
>with four eyes fixed  
>on the crest of forest in the distance.   
>"That'll give us shelter," I assured her.  
>
>And so we split  
>dawn took us in.  
>It seeped in us a sickly thought  
>Our pleasure dome was hollow leaves,   
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but built so beautifully.  
>I need not look beyond that figure,   
>lingering deaf and blind,   
>on the horizon.  It's you.    
>You'll give me shelter, if I surrender.  

*Kansas Sky* -- July 2022

>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.  
>Once suspended in the Kansas sky  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.   
>The eye which held a twinkle last night  
>Not from a star, but a lightning strike.  
>And here I gaze at Julie next to me    
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep  

*Untitled* -- May 2022

>Jackal toes and bloody lips  
>On the wall trickles and drips  
>Slips then slows to a crawl  
>Let it all congeal.  
>  
>The rabbit's jellied members  
>Cousins found in burnt-up embers  
>Whether or not they come around  
>That hound still shrieks. 
>  
>Festered paste birthed in mildew  
>Rancid stir of pustules brew  
>We the few who slurp that liqueur  
>While that whore moans.  
 
*Fierce creature* -- January 2020

>Fierce creature.  
>Her warm-armed currents  
>Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.  
>Pulsing violent,  
>Spewing caustic, emptying  
>Into basins which steam future desire,  
>Filled to quench days spent apart.
