<p><em>On First Looking into Chapman&rsquo;s Homer</em> &ndash; John Keats    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Much have I travell&rsquo;d in the realms of gold,<br>
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;<br>
Round many western islands have I been<br>
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.<br>
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br>
That deep-brow&rsquo;d Homer ruled as his demesne;<br>
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br>
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:<br>
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br>
When a new planet swims into his ken;<br>
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br>
He star&rsquo;d at the Pacific—and all his men<br>
Look&rsquo;d at each other with a wild surmise—<br>
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Kubla Khan</em> &ndash; Samuel Taylor Coleridge    <em><br /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, a vision in a dream.  A Fragment.</em></p></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
Through caverns measureless to man<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Down to a sunless sea.<br>
So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</p>
<p>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:<br>
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br>
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Floated midway on the waves;<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;From the fountain and the caves.<br>
It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</p>
<p>   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;In a vision once I saw:<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;It was an Abyssinian maid<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Could I revive within me<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Her symphony and song,<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;To such a deep delight ’twould win me,<br>
That with music loud and long,<br>
I would build that dome in air,<br>
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
And all who heard should see them there,<br>
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
And close your eyes with holy dread<br>
For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Compliment</em> &ndash; John Updike    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We were both of two minds about adultery<br>
and wasted our couple of stolen hours<br>
half-undressed in the Afternoon Motel<br>
kissing and drinking and doubting and forgoing.<br>
She had never betrayed her husband before.<br>
I said, &ldquo;O.K., so don&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s not.  This has been<br>
a lot of fun in any case.&rdquo;<br>
But something inquisitive in her, in Eve,<br>
would not move back from the brink,<br>
and after the longest, gentlest time lying<br>
side by side on the still-intact rented bed<br>
(I admiring her upper lip while it twitched<br>
in well-phrased trepidation, time running out),<br>
there was a surge as in a written exam<br>
when the answer had suddenly come to her;<br>
we completed the half left un- (see above),<br>
and the shy sea-creature of her ferny pubic hair<br>
gave me something else to admire, and<br>
a new aroma to activate my briny deeps.<br>
She was sweetly tight but not dry, not quite<br>
a virgin.  &ldquo;O.K.?&rdquo; I asked, half guilty,<br>
glancing over at her proximate profile.<br>
Tremulous eyelids nervily closed upon<br>
a dreaming vision of the fallen world&rsquo;s dooms,<br>
and all the web of her sensation bent<br>
to hold the pulsing bulk of this new captive,<br>
she breathed the single smiling word &ldquo;Terrific.&rdquo;</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>People at Night</em> &ndash; Rainer Maria Rilke    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Nights were not made for the crowds, and they sever<br>
You from your neighbor, so you shall never<br>
Seek him, defiantly, at night.<br>
But if you make your dark house light,<br>
To look on strangers in your room,<br>
You must reflect—on whom.</p>
<p>False lights that on men&rsquo;s faces play<br>
Distort them gruesomely.<br>
You look upon a disarray,<br>
A world that seems to reel and sway,<br>
A waving, glittering sea.<br>
On their foreheads gleams a yellow shine<br>
Where thoughts are chased away.<br>
Their glances flicker mad from wine,<br>
And to the words they say<br>
Strange heavy gestures make reply,<br>
That struggle in the buzzing room;<br>
And they say always, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo;;<br>
And mean—they know not whom.</p>    </blockquote></details>

<p><em>Ode (with love) to the gr10</em> &ndash; August 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>All 'round the mountains, the walkers wake.<br>
Beneath the drizzle, their coffees bake.<br>
High up where shadows drift on clouds' wake,<br>
whole legions eager to this quest undertake.</p>
<p>The stone remains stoic, as always, it seems.<br>
Even now when with all of these leeches it teems.<br>
Bundles in coats beyond Joseph's dreams,<br>
even the pack's cost counted in reams</p>
<p>of fabric exceeds all that for a king.<br>
If counting the contents, add that of his offspring.<br>
Hannibal's slaves would've killed for such things!<br>
Or herders of sheep on this trail they were blazing.</p>
<p>No planting or sowing, they're just passers-by,<br>
equipped with aluminum sticks they fly.<br>
Oh! How the Catalan cattle bells cry<br>
at wannabe Magellans and Sisyphi.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Da isy</em> &ndash; July 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Sunlight stained your bedroom walls.<br>
You and I hid baking in the sheets.<br>
Eyes shut, we searched<br>
and found each other’s skin<br>
still damp from the night.<br>
We took turns sinking back into sleep,<br>
fleeing our obligations to The Greats<br>
who paved the city streets.</p>
<p>After noon we emerged<br>
to face the day:<br>
our groggy eyes opened;<br>
your dimples glistened.<br>
We feasted<br>
on beauty eternal, carved into stone<br>
and on beauty fleeting, your tender lips<br>
wrapped around a burning cigarette.</p>
<p>You took your last drag.<br>
And from the ashes,<br>
a daisy was born,<br>
meant only to wilt.<br>
And so I tried<br>
to catch each petal as it fell.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>As if.</em> &ndash; July 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>She’s a mystery.<br>
As if I wanted to cling on to her drapes<br>
to reveal a clouded sky.<br>
As if I wanted to know.<br>
As if she wanted the same.<br>
As if I didn’t mull<br>
for some time before she woke<br>
over whether my fingers<br>
could lace into hers. Now it’s<br>
as if the thought never entered<br>
my mind, but<br>
it hasn’t left either,<br>
as if it’s been<br>
gliding around inside<br>
for an eternity already.</p>
<p>As if I couldn’t see when you were<br>
lying. I lied back as if<br>
you couldn’t do the same. As if<br>
I didn’t see how you two said<br>
goodbye. Him all red and smiling as if<br>
he were drunk. As if<br>
I didn’t look down to<br>
see his red, drunk, smiling hand<br>
brush your waist as he turned<br>
to walk away, as if<br>
I weren’t there, as if<br>
I didn’t care. As if<br>
I cared.</p>
<p>As if sex were a commitment.<br>
As if it didn’t exist only in the instant.<br>
As if thoughts of your sex had been<br>
gliding around inside<br>
for an eternity already.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; June 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Morning growls<br>
While the di-named lioness<br>
In exhaling betrays<br>
Her thoughts hidden still<br>
On that hillside crest<br>
Where our fallen arms defined us<br>
As the grass defined the meadow.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Free to float</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If he could float from tree to tree,<br>
on which clichés he’d perch?<br>
Barefoot on her knife’s edge,<br>
or rocking the cradle to ease<br>
Babe<br>
back to sleep.<br>
Back to dream states<br>
where men, like birds,<br>
are free to float from tree to tree.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>While in decline</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The sun still shines while in decline<br>
And bees slave all their lives<br>
Sea waves collapse in foamy smacks<br>
And trees in hollow snaps.</p>
<p>A man may choose to honey bathe<br>
Or surf the lightning’s strike<br>
But he like all must heed the call<br>
Of sunset on his back.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled triad</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait</p>
<p>For them to heal before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again</p>
<p>And when I do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll come to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and crack yours too</p>
<p>The fractures’ll fill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the other</p>
<p>The reluctant sheet<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between our feet</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Moroccan mist</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Moroccan mist evaporates away<br>
From all the dusty hash that filled our lungs<br>
An offer Flo a coffee kind of day<br>
Afloat but crooked, far from ferry’s strait.</p>
<p>We’d rather stop for cars and caravans<br>
We waited wafting in the evening gas<br>
To every city vite-fait brined in wine<br>
For Tim as well who kept the rhythm’s beat.</p>
<p>Till Basque I surfed to take the solo lead<br>
Far from the hold of Silvio’s belay<br>
Without a name I spun that game of chance<br>
And downed those drunken sips of Leah’s sweet.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Watch</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Watch through the window<br>
the mug that wobbles unprompted<br>
wait wait and watch<br>
the shards that settle among the crumbs<br>
wait outside an hour<br>
after the shatter settles<br>
and the lowly he rises<br>
to lick the spill off the tile<br>
like a dog</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; April 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Puddles stain the pavement<br>
under sun’s afternoon<br>
trampled by the tourists'<br>
dampened leather shoes.</p>
<p>Slouching on a concrete bench<br>
sidelining the plaza,<br>
he’s chewing on some homesick<br>
and his heart’s beating blue.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>The doghouse</em> &ndash; April 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Awakened in a troubling grime,<br>
the morning crawls out of the doghouse<br>
to confront its own ragged, plastic self.<br>
It whinges, squeaks, shudders<br>
and slumps back inside,<br>
packed in with the other.</p>
<p>Their mammalian hides<br>
side by side - crystalline.<br>
In heavy wimpers<br>
one expands while the other contracts.<br>
Both frightened<br>
by the heightened sense that lasts<br>
dew-dampened before the fall<br>
of noon’s eventual descent.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Un mardi soir</em> &ndash; March 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Du temps perdu<br>
sous la pluie<br>
d’un mardi soir.<br>
Trempé, il se déchire tout seul<br>
quand on essaie de ramasser<br>
ce qui en reste de la table<br>
après qu’elle parte.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>The tower</em> &ndash; February 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>His eyes and Hers align to keep<br>
panoptic, periodic rhyme at sea<br>
and frothy mermen arms outreached<br>
for prey who slips away beneath<br>
the tower’s twin-turn stare.</p>
<p>Frustrated shadows lurk below<br>
for sheer is water as it flows<br>
firmly caught within the tow<br>
of Their revolving omniglow<br>
where washed-up mysteries lay bare.</p>
<p>Then one night the twin pair winked —<br>
Her brother fell from tower’s brink.<br>
Straight He dove and straight He’ll sink.<br>
Sister waterlogged by weeps,<br>
She cast Her duty off without a care.</p>
<p>Storms arise when rhythm’s lost,<br>
sirens shriek like albatross,<br>
long-drowned urchins shed their moss,<br>
nocturne barges glide across<br>
the purview of a watch in disrepair.</p>
<p>By dawn Her misery ossified.<br>
A corroded heart beats in half-time<br>
all while shadows grow twice as wide.<br>
Her mood now high and low like tide<br>
ever bound to the pull of out there.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>In the dark</em> &ndash; January 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Pinned to dusk and strung like wire<br>
Tower the branches' fractal spires</p>
<p>A brass bell drones with windy pull<br>
Dull reverberations chill the air<br>
Birdlings dream and spiders' drool<br>
Seeps into webs of waxen stare</p>
<p>Never a crack nor rust nor grime<br>
Hours to ages pierce without remark<br>
The lonesome architect’s got time<br>
To manufacture beauty in the dark</p>
<p>These streaks will soon be printed on the dawn<br>
Where fractal spires linger on and on.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>A cool, dry place</em> &ndash; January 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Sitting pristine in her sleeve<br>
plastic shrink wrapped unscratched<br>
unplayed her ways unheard<br>
wait to be<br>
instead left<br>
bought and forgot<br>
In a cool, dry place.</p>
<p>Could she ever do what others do ?<br>
Be used as lovers use ?</p>
<p>Cut up and torn off<br>
clicked nicked greased up and down<br>
soaked and dried<br>
out spun around and flexed<br>
And also<br>
one day forgotten</p>
<p>Then they’ll do what others do,<br>
And leave as lovers leave.</p>
<p>Set to dust collecting<br>
spores or moss tossed<br>
under another<br>
overplayed eventually clichéd<br>
wedged among the others<br>
In a cool, dry place.</p>    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Monorhyme sketch #3</em> &ndash; December 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Goldilocks was feeling bold,<br>
For each bear was poured a bowl.<br>
Her belly roiled with each spoonful:<br>
Cold, more cold, and much more cold.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Monorhyme sketch #2</em> &ndash; November 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Play back the track slow with all ears clear<br>
Sycophants’ll scatter off or cower with fear<br>
Honest men’ll settle in, lonesomely austere<br>
Chimney fire cackling to toss another beer.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Monorhyme sketch #1</em> &ndash; November 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Alcohol is entropy, and entropy is time<br>
Hungover before I transitively unwind.<br>
Wilted flowers wither while I dine on rotten wine<br>
And ever wet the whistle of a lover once mine.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Ode to Sami</em> &ndash; November 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Our man’s evaporated — gone.<br>
After the party rises dawn<br>
A quiet, calmer house he leaves<br>
Infused with that which he believes.<br>
Now off to scrub ancestral mire<br>
From the grounds of Imane’s spire<br>
For shines a hope in progeny<br>
That’s barely grazed by coloc-amis.</p>
<p>As he ascends to the fourth floor<br>
We’re sewing stitches evermore<br>
His scalpel sketched the lessons learned<br>
Into our cheeks the stories burn<br>
Red-raw from cold or rush of blood<br>
At Sami’s wisdom understood.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Chicory root</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>An afternoon with chicory root<br>
My heart respires a holler and hoot<br>
Sans caffeine so must be due<br>
À la frange d’Aubrée, surtout</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled couples</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Bound up inside, a voice he wimpers on,<br>
“Bring back the soft of touch that long has gone…”</p>
<p>What waste of blood to keep that louse around<br>
— I’ll take my heart to firm or fertile ground.</p>
<p>I peer upstream to tempt the river’s way<br>
When new soleil he shines and dawns the day.</p>
<p>My thrill it shimmers on the sandy cusp<br>
Of virgin plain untouched by Sodom’s rust.</p>
<p>I’ll feign defense to pangs that thrust me out<br>
Beyond the surface dissipating shroud.</p>
<p>With that I’ll rise above the tar that blinds<br>
Before I’ve found the words for th’other side.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Limp</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>As I ran by I saw you lying<br>
limp along the sidewalk<br>
Unforced serendipity<br>
I didn’t watch the clock</p>
<p>You seemed as well as one could seem<br>
prostrate on the floor<br>
Peaceful even, drowned amidst<br>
the waves of foreign shore</p>
<p>I wondered how you landed here<br>
your wings a crumpled mess<br>
A fall from sunlight’s brazen stare<br>
onto my path ingressed</p>
<p>I lay my hand to light first flame<br>
since summer’s hibernation<br>
But you’ve cooled your gaze to stone<br>
and cast it in the ocean</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>A raven&rsquo;s lust</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A pressing matter of morning walks,<br>
A pressure on the heart.<br>
She marches, tramples, stomps, and stalks<br>
My mind while we’re apart.</p>
<p>We both agree to guard our distance,<br>
But hunger grows like wolf to sheep<br>
Whose prey is stoled by thornèd fence.<br>
A raven’s lust at bay to keep.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>September slump</em> &ndash; September 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Obsessively revising<br>
Self-consuming second guessing<br>
Seeking sense in something<br>
set aflame by sorry selfish me.</p>
<p>Hiving scared hungover<br>
from a hopeless couple months<br>
of perfect idleness I passed beneath<br>
your gentle glowing grange.</p>
<p>And once again I wash in vain<br>
to free my will from moping<br>
Meaning while I wait I’m anxiously aware<br>
that every waking moment means<br>
the more and more you drift away from me.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Hm, apparently Pompeii isn't in Greece</em> &ndash; September 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>It’s New Year’s Eve on Mount Vesuvius<br>
Eruption warnings are dubious<br>
Togas loose, libations plenty<br>
The dance floor rumbles our favorite melody<br>
We brink dance to Old Hades' cry<br>
Who beckons us to chase our high<br>
His cavelings squirm through cracks to join us<br>
Sweet smoke consumes our rowdy chorus<br>
And so we played as spirits fused<br>
Unified, with stamina imbued<br>
We’ll party on ‘til liquid rock arrives<br>
‘Til ash and friends should come alive…</p>
<p>…With might was dawn’s great geyser freed<br>
At that, our wine-dark punch bowl emptied<br>
Thus could raise one goblet all<br>
So that our tombstones may stand tall.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; August 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A giant in the shoes of a man<br>
A god wrapped in a mortal’s pelt<br>
A beggar assuming a rich man’s svelte<br>
A one-trick pony who wows again.</p>
<p>All those they rose under a cool twilight eve<br>
With friends and unknowns alike<br>
A savory potluck among salty waves reaching<br>
Ever closer, ‘neath the call of soft moonlight.</p>
<p>But from the water’s flesh, soggy cripples emerged<br>
Each more grotesque than the last<br>
Until the bastard crew’s final lizard<br>
Crawled out, terrorizing the virgin grass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>« Oh ! How he howled like a pig<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all mixed up in his own blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his own foul slime! »</em></p>
<p>The giant, at this he slouched<br>
The god took years on his shoulders<br>
The beggar sat and wept, his appetite lost<br>
The lame pony spooked off, driven mad by the odours.</p>
<p>Those hogs slabbered with haste, as if at the trough<br>
Sweet death had complied with their final demand<br>
All noble spirits on the shore had crumpled<br>
For heavy are the souls of the damned.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Crossing your path</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I’d like to cross your path from time to time<br>
To say ‘Hello’ and then ‘Goodbye’<br>
And leave a little tune behind<br>
— That once we knew by heart<br>
Now worn with time —<br>
To hum that song of ours.</p>
<p>Oh, hum that song of ours<br>
Remind me how it goes, I’ve lost the rhyme.<br>
While some day soon or far<br>
You’ll sing a song I’ve never heard before<br>
It’ll drive me mad, convinced I know the words<br>
And how it ends, from hook to final verse.</p>
<p>But if that soon or far appears<br>
Tomorrow or Today<br>
Not sure how read’ly I’d admit<br>
Your verse with him struck something new<br>
And better than the one we wrote<br>
Just for me and you.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled pt. 2</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>and the end it was so brief half an hour in the park and we didnt even break open the pulco and sparkling water</p>
<p>she was calm as was i there was maybe a single moment where a tear was held back</p>
<p>oh isnt it complicated to close the book of belle hectic mornings and pale razorburnt legs out in the world lovely lovely and probably crying brutally alone in her bed as i write this</p>
<p>sleep will come easier as i read it back each night knowing with each recitation ill fade further onto her horizon.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If ever a lonely night<br>
Should you wake in a sharp tremor<br>
From a passing specter’s strike<br>
Whose trailing vapors leak a sweet scent<br>
That only you and I could recognize…</p>
<p>Écrase-le !<br>
Et moi je vais faire pareil<br>
Il n’est rien qu’un moustique qui vit de l’obscurité<br>
Un porte-souvenir des nuits si chauds<br>
Et ses piqûres guériront par l’aube du lendemain</p>
<p>Même si l’odeur persiste toujours<br>
Cet odeur dont l’existence le matin<br>
révèle que ce rêve<br>
Ne vivait pas que dans ta tête<br>
Ni que pendant la nuit</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Whalebone branches</em> &ndash; June 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Whalebone branches<br>
they bellow and spill<br>
leaves torn from their bindings<br>
onto all the stand-buyers<br>
in the widening gyre.</p>
<p>Those urchins from Ur<br>
with their babbling burns<br>
each scar submits a solution<br>
“Not a 5-over-1, it’s just so overdone.”<br>
A sober flight takes thought<br>
with a rabid Star Fox<br>
whose atavistic impulses<br>
barrel-roll to steal the old<br>
from the Niagara Cafe.</p>
<p>And maybe in its depths<br>
he’ll ask directions<br>
from the Maidens of Mist.<br>
They’ll turn tablets to clay<br>
declare “La vie est une scie”<br>
buy a round for all<br>
the hypocrites of twenty twenty-three.</p>
<p>Silver tongues will take a lick,<br>
restore our faith in Moby Dick,<br>
find ourselves like that Tarkovsky flick,<br>
till no warm-blooded carcass persists.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; May 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Accro à la banalité<br>
A la recherche d’une bière<br>
Tellement de temps bu<br>
Sans rien faire<br>
Chasseurs des pique-niques<br>
Cuites au soleil<br>
Brillants sommes nous<br>
Les lapins d’été</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Those oozing stacks grow</em> &ndash; April 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I want to tell of carcasses stacked tall<br>
Of honey dried out at crusty summer’s fall<br>
That bridge appeared and beckoned passers-by<br>
To give the yonder ravine’s edge a try.</p>
<p>So you and her, cutting through the weeds —<br>
Trudged, creaking, above the misty deeps<br>
In search of fire to warm your tender skin<br>
or adventure’s strike to bake you from within.<br>
But an hour’s passed and still ye edge along<br>
uncertain heartbeats pound a booming song.</p>
<p>All while we howl and screech out for you<br>
“Oh lovelies, you’ve never seen splendors more true<br>
than that which awaits all who cross the border<br>
and abides by our master’s all-knowing order”<br>
Put candidly, just once, for the hatchlings to our realm<br>
Take a dive, be immersed, as a feather to inkwell.</p>
<p>You smirked and wrote verse, your spirits were high<br>
Eager for the taverns where they’ll chant your hero’s cry<br>
And so ye arrive, dock on our shores<br>
waves hit with sting, mixing afters and befores<br>
Drowning on the cliff, you hold each other tight<br>
Swords drawn, side by side, ready for the fight…</p>
<p>…Excuse me, dear listener,<br>
I’ll divulge nothing more.<br>
Our master<br>
would rather<br>
cast shadows<br>
than lore.</p>
<p>I promised sick tales of flesh piled high<br>
but suffice it to know<br>
those oozing stacks grow<br>
with each ripe passerby.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Bruges pluie blues</em> &ndash; March 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Il plu dans cette vielle ville<br>
Pendant ces vacances débiles<br>
Où j’accompagne mes parents<br>
Qui connaissent Bruges d’un film</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Untitled night</em> &ndash; February 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Her animal lay wild,<br>
hunched, and prowling in its cage<br>
with iron bars made brittle by<br>
the advance of our seduction.<br>
Then one day she pounced and bared<br>
— Breathing with her whole body like an organ.<br>
An affront to what I used to know as “passion”.</p>
<p>At once the wilderness subsided<br>
and we both froze then melted.<br>
She stepped fully into me,<br>
hesitation revealed to be<br>
footprints parting in the sand<br>
as evening tide approaches.<br>
— Call it a kind of destiny<br>
we’d read between the waves.</p>
<p>So I gave myself relentlessly,<br>
inspired by that ferocity<br>
eager claws know well to be<br>
lurking beneath the dirt.<br>
And finally, when she drew blood,<br>
evinced our last temptation<br>
— We shared her gristle-ridden lair<br>
fused together, cast in crimson.</p>    </blockquote>    </details>

    <p><em>Kansas sky</em> &ndash; July 2022</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.<br>
Once suspended in the Kansas sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.<br>
The eye which held a twinkle last night<br>
Not from a star, but a lightning strike.<br>
And here I gaze at Julie next to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Like jackals, lips slippery</em> &ndash; May 2022</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Jackal toes and bloody lips<br>
On the wall trickles and drips<br>
Slips then slows to a crawl<br>
Let it all congeal.</p>
<p>The rabbit’s jellied members<br>
Cousins found in burnt-up embers<br>
Whether or not they come around<br>
That hound still shrieks.</p>
<p>Festered paste birthed in mildew<br>
Rancid stir of pustules brew<br>
We the few who slurp that liqueur<br>
While her dusty lips moan.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Fierce creature</em> &ndash; January 2020</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Fierce creature.<br>
Her warm-armed currents<br>
Race beneath hazy burgundy skies.<br>
Pulsing violent,<br>
Spewing caustic, emptying<br>
Into basins which steam future desire,<br>
Filled to quench days spent apart.</p>    </blockquote>    </details>
