<p><em>Free to float</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If he could float from tree to tree,<br>
on which clichés he’d perch?<br>
Barefoot on her knife’s edge,<br>
or rocking the cradle to ease<br>
Babe<br>
back to sleep.<br>
Back to dream states<br>
where men, like birds,<br>
are free to float from tree to tree.</p>    </blockquote>
