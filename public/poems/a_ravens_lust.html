<p><em>A raven&rsquo;s lust</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <div class="poem"><p><span class="line">A pressing matter of morning walks,</span><br>
<span class="line">A pressure on the heart.</span><br>
<span class="line">She marches, tramples, stomps, and stalks</span><br>
<span class="line">My mind while we’re apart.</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">We both agree to guard our distance,</span><br>
<span class="line">But hunger grows like wolf to sheep</span><br>
<span class="line">Whose prey is stoled by thornèd fence.</span><br>
<span class="line">A raven’s lust at bay to keep.</p></div>    </blockquote>
