<p><em>Untitled</em> &ndash; August 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A giant in the shoes of a man<br>
A god wrapped in a mortal’s pelt<br>
A beggar assuming a rich man’s svelte<br>
A one-trick pony who wows again.</p>
<p>All those they rose under a cool twilight eve<br>
With friends and unknowns alike<br>
A savory potluck among salty waves reaching<br>
Ever closer, ‘neath the call of soft moonlight.</p>
<p>But from the water’s flesh, soggy cripples emerged<br>
Each more grotesque than the last<br>
Until the bastard crew’s final lizard<br>
Crawled out, terrorizing the virgin grass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>« Oh ! How he howled like a pig<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all mixed up in his own blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his own foul slime! »</em></p>
<p>The giant, at this he slouched<br>
The god took years on his shoulders<br>
The beggar sat and wept, his appetite lost<br>
The lame pony spooked off, driven mad by the odours.</p>
<p>Those hogs slabbered with haste, as if at the trough<br>
Sweet death had complied with their final demand<br>
All noble spirits on the shore had crumpled<br>
For heavy are the souls of the damned.</p>    </blockquote>
