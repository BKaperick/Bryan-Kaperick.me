<p><em>Ode to Sami</em> &ndash; November 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Our man’s evaporated — gone.<br>
After the party rises dawn<br>
A quiet, calmer house he leaves<br>
Infused with that which he believes.<br>
Now off to scrub ancestral mire<br>
From the grounds of Imane’s spire<br>
For shines a hope in progeny<br>
That’s barely grazed by coloc-amis.</p>
<p>As he ascends to the fourth floor<br>
We’re sewing stitches evermore<br>
His scalpel sketched the lessons learned<br>
Into our cheeks the stories burn<br>
Red-raw from cold or rush of blood<br>
At Sami’s wisdom understood.</p>    </blockquote>
