<p><em>Kansas sky</em> &ndash; July 2022</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>This morning I watched a cloud fall to earth.<br>
Once suspended in the Kansas sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now turned to vapor in my eye.<br>
The eye which held a twinkle last night<br>
Not from a star, but a lightning strike.<br>
And here I gaze at Julie next to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes my cloud and twinkle and goes to sleep</p>    </blockquote>
