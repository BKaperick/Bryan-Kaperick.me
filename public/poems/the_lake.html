<p><em>The lake</em> &ndash; September 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <div class="poem"><p>Dusk called you on a quest for your reflection.<br>
Comment dire le fait de "se remettre en question" ?<br>
Lounging at the lake brim,<br>
the water showed an unfamiliar apparition.</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p>You looked, in search of a placid reassurance.<br>
He stared back with a rippling insolence,<br>
gripping in its wickedness,<br>
quick to erode the fangs of your innocence.</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p>So you're swimming in the mire of your contrapart<br>
with anguish shining cleaner than its grime depart.<br>
Dawn wakes you with a start,<br>
for the spirit of the lake has replaced your heart.</p></div>    </blockquote>
