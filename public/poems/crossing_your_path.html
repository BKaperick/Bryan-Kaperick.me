<p><em>Crossing your path</em> &ndash; July 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I’d like to cross your path from time to time<br>
To say ‘Hello’ and then ‘Goodbye’<br>
And leave a little tune behind<br>
— That once we knew by heart<br>
Now worn with time —<br>
To hum that song of ours.</p>
<p>Oh, hum that song of ours<br>
Remind me how it goes, I’ve lost the rhyme.<br>
While some day soon or far<br>
You’ll sing a song I’ve never heard before<br>
It’ll drive me mad, convinced I know the words<br>
And how it ends, from hook to final verse.</p>
<p>But if that soon or far appears<br>
Tomorrow or Today<br>
Not sure how read’ly I’d admit<br>
Your verse with him struck something new<br>
And better than the one we wrote<br>
Just for me and you.</p>    </blockquote>
