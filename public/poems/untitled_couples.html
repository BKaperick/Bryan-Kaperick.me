<p><em>Untitled couples</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Bound up inside, a voice he wimpers on,<br>
“Bring back the soft of touch that long has gone…”</p>
<p>What waste of blood to keep that louse around<br>
— I’ll take my heart to firm or fertile ground.</p>
<p>I peer upstream to tempt the river’s way<br>
When new soleil he shines and dawns the day.</p>
<p>My thrill it shimmers on the sandy cusp<br>
Of virgin plain untouched by Sodom’s rust.</p>
<p>I’ll feign defense to pangs that thrust me out<br>
Beyond the surface dissipating shroud.</p>
<p>With that I’ll rise above the tar that blinds<br>
Before I’ve found the words for th’other side.</p>    </blockquote>
