<p><em>Whalebone branches</em> &ndash; June 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Whalebone branches<br>
they bellow and spill<br>
leaves torn from their bindings<br>
onto all the stand-buyers<br>
in the widening gyre.</p>
<p>Those urchins from Ur<br>
with their babbling burns<br>
each scar submits a solution<br>
“Not a 5-over-1, it’s just so overdone.”<br>
A sober flight takes thought<br>
with a rabid Star Fox<br>
whose atavistic impulses<br>
barrel-roll to steal the old<br>
from the Niagara Cafe.</p>
<p>And maybe in its depths<br>
he’ll ask directions<br>
from the Maidens of Mist.<br>
They’ll turn tablets to clay<br>
declare “La vie est une scie”<br>
buy a round for all<br>
the hypocrites of twenty twenty-three.</p>
<p>Silver tongues will take a lick,<br>
restore our faith in Moby Dick,<br>
find ourselves like that Tarkovsky flick,<br>
till no warm-blooded carcass persists.</p>    </blockquote>
