<p><em>Moroccan mist</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Moroccan mist evaporates away<br>
From all the dusty hash that filled our lungs<br>
An offer Flo a coffee kind of day<br>
Afloat but crooked, far from ferry’s strait.</p>
<p>We’d rather stop for cars and caravans<br>
We waited wafting in the evening gas<br>
To every city vite-fait brined in wine<br>
For Tim as well who kept the rhythm’s beat.</p>
<p>Till Basque I surfed to take the solo lead<br>
Far from the hold of Silvio’s belay<br>
Without a name I spun that game of chance<br>
And downed those drunken sips of Leah’s sweet.</p>    </blockquote>
