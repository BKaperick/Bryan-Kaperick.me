<p><em>Untitled night</em> &ndash; February 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Her animal lay wild,<br>
hunched, and prowling in its cage<br>
with iron bars made brittle by<br>
the advance of our seduction.<br>
Then one day she pounced and bared<br>
— Breathing with her whole body like an organ.<br>
An affront to what I used to know as “passion”.</p>
<p>At once the wilderness subsided<br>
and we both froze then melted.<br>
She stepped fully into me,<br>
hesitation revealed to be<br>
footprints parting in the sand<br>
as evening tide approaches.<br>
— Call it a kind of destiny<br>
we’d read between the waves.</p>
<p>So I gave myself relentlessly,<br>
inspired by that ferocity<br>
eager claws know well to be<br>
lurking beneath the dirt.<br>
And finally, when she drew blood,<br>
evinced our last temptation<br>
— We shared her gristle-ridden lair<br>
fused together, cast in crimson.</p>    </blockquote>
