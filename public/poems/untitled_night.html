<p><em>Untitled night</em> &ndash; February 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <div class="poem"><p><span class="line">Her animal lay wild,</span><br>
<span class="line">hunched, and prowling in its cage</span><br>
<span class="line">with iron bars made brittle by</span><br>
<span class="line">the advance of our seduction.</span><br>
<span class="line">Then one day she pounced and bared</span><br>
<span class="line">— Breathing with her whole body like an organ.</span><br>
<span class="line">An affront to what I used to know as “passion”.</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">At once the wilderness subsided</span><br>
<span class="line">and we both froze then melted.</span><br>
<span class="line">She stepped fully into me,</span><br>
<span class="line">hesitation revealed to be</span><br>
<span class="line">footprints parting in the sand</span><br>
<span class="line">as evening tide approaches.</span><br>
<span class="line">— Call it a kind of destiny</span><br>
<span class="line">we’d read between the waves.</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">So I gave myself relentlessly,</span><br>
<span class="line">inspired by that ferocity</span><br>
<span class="line">eager claws know well to be</span><br>
<span class="line">lurking beneath the dirt.</span><br>
<span class="line">And finally, when she drew blood,</span><br>
<span class="line">evinced our last temptation</span><br>
<span class="line">— We shared her gristle-ridden lair</span><br>
<span class="line">fused together, cast in crimson.</p></div>    </blockquote>
