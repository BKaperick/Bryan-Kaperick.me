<p><em>A cool, dry place</em> &ndash; January 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Sitting pristine in her sleeve<br>
plastic shrink wrapped unscratched<br>
unplayed her ways unheard<br>
wait to be<br>
instead left<br>
bought and forgot<br>
In a cool, dry place.</p>
<p>Could she ever do what others do ?<br>
Be used as lovers use ?</p>
<p>Cut up and torn off<br>
clicked nicked greased up and down<br>
soaked and dried<br>
out spun around and flexed<br>
And also<br>
one day forgotten</p>
<p>Then they’ll do what others do,<br>
And leave as lovers leave.</p>
<p>Set to dust collecting<br>
spores or moss tossed<br>
under another<br>
overplayed eventually clichéd<br>
wedged among the others<br>
In a cool, dry place.</p>    </blockquote>
