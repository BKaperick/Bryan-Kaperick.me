<p><em>Da isy</em> &ndash; July 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <div class="poem"><p><span class="line">Sunlight stained your bedroom walls.</span><br>
<span class="line">You and I hid baking in the sheets.</span><br>
<span class="line">Eyes shut, we searched</span><br>
<span class="line">and found each otherâ€™s skin</span><br>
<span class="line">still damp from the night.</span><br>
<span class="line">We took turns sinking back into sleep,</span><br>
<span class="line">fleeing our obligations to The Greats</span><br>
<span class="line">who paved the city streets.</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">After noon we emerged</span><br>
<span class="line">to face the day:</span><br>
<span class="line">our groggy eyes opened;</span><br>
<span class="line">your dimples glistened.</span><br>
<span class="line">We feasted</span><br>
<span class="line">on beauty eternal, carved into stone</span><br>
<span class="line">and on beauty fleeting, your tender lips</span><br>
<span class="line">wrapped around a burning cigarette.</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">You took your last drag.</span><br>
<span class="line">And from the ashes,</span><br>
<span class="line">a daisy was born,</span><br>
<span class="line">meant only to wilt.</span><br>
<span class="line">And so I tried</span><br>
<span class="line">to catch each petal as it fell.</p></div>    </blockquote>
