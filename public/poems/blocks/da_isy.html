<p><em>Da isy</em> &ndash; July 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Sunlight stained your bedroom walls.<br>
You and I hid baking in the sheets.<br>
Eyes shut, we searched<br>
and found each otherâ€™s skin<br>
still damp from the night.<br>
We took turns sinking back into sleep,<br>
fleeing our obligations to The Greats<br>
who paved the city streets.</p>
<p>After noon we emerged<br>
to face the day:<br>
our groggy eyes opened;<br>
your dimples glistened.<br>
We feasted<br>
on beauty eternal, carved into stone<br>
and on beauty fleeting, your tender lips<br>
wrapped around a burning cigarette.</p>
<p>You took your last drag.<br>
And from the ashes,<br>
a daisy was born,<br>
meant only to wilt.<br>
And so I tried<br>
to catch each petal as it fell.</p>    </blockquote>
