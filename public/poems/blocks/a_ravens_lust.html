<p><em>A raven&rsquo;s lust</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A pressing matter of morning walks,<br>
A pressure on the heart.<br>
She marches, tramples, stomps, and stalks<br>
My mind while we’re apart.</p>
<p>We both agree to guard our distance,<br>
But hunger grows like wolf to sheep<br>
Whose prey is stoled by thornèd fence.<br>
A raven’s lust at bay to keep.</p>    </blockquote>
