<p><em>The doghouse</em> &ndash; April 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Awakened in a troubling grime,<br>
the morning crawls out of the doghouse<br>
to confront its own ragged, plastic self.<br>
It whinges, squeaks, shudders<br>
and slumps back inside,<br>
packed in with the other.</p>
<p>Their mammalian hides<br>
side by side - crystalline.<br>
In heavy wimpers<br>
one expands while the other contracts.<br>
Both frightened<br>
by the heightened sense that lasts<br>
dew-dampened before the fall<br>
of noonâ€™s eventual descent.</p>    </blockquote>
