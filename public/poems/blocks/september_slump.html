<p><em>September slump</em> &ndash; September 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Obsessively revising<br>
Self-consuming second guessing<br>
Seeking sense in something<br>
set aflame by sorry selfish me.</p>
<p>Hiving scared hungover<br>
from a hopeless couple months<br>
of perfect idleness I passed beneath<br>
your gentle glowing grange.</p>
<p>And once again I wash in vain<br>
to free my will from moping<br>
Meaning while I wait Iâ€™m anxiously aware<br>
that every waking moment means<br>
the more and more you drift away from me.</p>    </blockquote>
