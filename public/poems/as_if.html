<p><em>As if.</em> &ndash; July 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>She’s a mystery.<br>
As if I wanted to cling on to her drapes<br>
to reveal a clouded sky.<br>
As if I wanted to know.<br>
As if she wanted the same.<br>
As if I didn’t mull<br>
for some time before she woke<br>
over whether my fingers<br>
could lace into hers. Now it’s<br>
as if the thought never entered<br>
my mind, but<br>
it hasn’t left either,<br>
as if it’s been<br>
gliding around inside<br>
for an eternity already.</p>
<p>As if I couldn’t see when you were<br>
lying. I lied back as if<br>
you couldn’t do the same. As if<br>
I didn’t see how you two said<br>
goodbye. Him all red and smiling as if<br>
he were drunk. As if<br>
I didn’t look down to<br>
see his red, drunk, smiling hand<br>
brush your waist as he turned<br>
to walk away, as if<br>
I weren’t there, as if<br>
I didn’t care. As if<br>
I cared.</p>
<p>As if sex were a commitment.<br>
As if it didn’t exist only in the instant.<br>
As if thoughts of your sex had been<br>
gliding around inside<br>
for an eternity already.</p>    </blockquote>
