<p><em>Those oozing stacks grow</em> &ndash; April 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I want to tell of carcasses stacked tall<br>
Of honey dried out at crusty summer’s fall<br>
That bridge appeared and beckoned passers-by<br>
To give the yonder ravine’s edge a try.</p>
<p>So you and her, cutting through the weeds —<br>
Trudged, creaking, above the misty deeps<br>
In search of fire to warm your tender skin<br>
or adventure’s strike to bake you from within.<br>
But an hour’s passed and still ye edge along<br>
uncertain heartbeats pound a booming song.</p>
<p>All while we howl and screech out for you<br>
“Oh lovelies, you’ve never seen splendors more true<br>
than that which awaits all who cross the border<br>
and abides by our master’s all-knowing order”<br>
Put candidly, just once, for the hatchlings to our realm<br>
Take a dive, be immersed, as a feather to inkwell.</p>
<p>You smirked and wrote verse, your spirits were high<br>
Eager for the taverns where they’ll chant your hero’s cry<br>
And so ye arrive, dock on our shores<br>
waves hit with sting, mixing afters and befores<br>
Drowning on the cliff, you hold each other tight<br>
Swords drawn, side by side, ready for the fight…</p>
<p>…Excuse me, dear listener,<br>
I’ll divulge nothing more.<br>
Our master<br>
would rather<br>
cast shadows<br>
than lore.</p>
<p>I promised sick tales of flesh piled high<br>
but suffice it to know<br>
those oozing stacks grow<br>
with each ripe passerby.</p>    </blockquote>
