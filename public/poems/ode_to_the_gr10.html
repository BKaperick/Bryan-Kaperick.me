<p><em>Ode (with love) to the gr10</em> &ndash; August 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>All 'round the mountains, the walkers wake.<br>
Beneath the drizzle, their coffees bake.<br>
High up where shadows drift on clouds' wake,<br>
whole legions eager to this quest undertake.</p>
<p>The stone remains stoic, as always, it seems.<br>
Even now when with all of these leeches it teems.<br>
Bundles in coats beyond Joseph's dreams,<br>
even the pack's cost counted in reams</p>
<p>of fabric exceeds all that for a king.<br>
If counting the contents, add that of his offspring.<br>
Hannibal's slaves would've killed for such things!<br>
Or herders of sheep on this trail they were blazing.</p>
<p>No planting or sowing, they're just passers-by,<br>
equipped with aluminum sticks they fly.<br>
Oh! How the Catalan cattle bells cry<br>
at wannabe Magellans and Sisyphi.</p>    </blockquote>
