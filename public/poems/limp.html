<p><em>Limp</em> &ndash; October 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>As I ran by I saw you lying<br>
limp along the sidewalk<br>
Unforced serendipity<br>
I didn’t watch the clock</p>
<p>You seemed as well as one could seem<br>
prostrate on the floor<br>
Peaceful even, drowned amidst<br>
the waves of foreign shore</p>
<p>I wondered how you landed here<br>
your wings a crumpled mess<br>
A fall from sunlight’s brazen stare<br>
onto my path ingressed</p>
<p>I lay my hand to light first flame<br>
since summer’s hibernation<br>
But you’ve cooled your gaze to stone<br>
and cast it in the ocean</p>    </blockquote>
