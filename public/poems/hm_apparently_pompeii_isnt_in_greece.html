<p><em>Hm, apparently Pompeii isn't in Greece</em> &ndash; September 2023</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>It’s New Year’s Eve on Mount Vesuvius<br>
Eruption warnings are dubious<br>
Togas loose, libations plenty<br>
The dance floor rumbles our favorite melody<br>
We brink dance to Old Hades' cry<br>
Who beckons us to chase our high<br>
His cavelings squirm through cracks to join us<br>
Sweet smoke consumes our rowdy chorus<br>
And so we played as spirits fused<br>
Unified, with stamina imbued<br>
We’ll party on ‘til liquid rock arrives<br>
‘Til ash and friends should come alive…</p>
<p>…With might was dawn’s great geyser freed<br>
At that, our wine-dark punch bowl emptied<br>
Thus could raise one goblet all<br>
So that our tombstones may stand tall.</p>    </blockquote>
