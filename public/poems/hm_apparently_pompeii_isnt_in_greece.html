<p><em>Hm, apparently Pompeii isn't in Greece</em> &ndash; September 2023</p>

    <div class="poem"><p><span class="line">It’s New Year’s Eve on Mount Vesuvius</span><br>
<span class="line">Eruption warnings are dubious</span><br>
<span class="line">Togas loose, libations plenty</span><br>
<span class="line">The dance floor rumbles our favorite melody</span><br>
<span class="line">We brink dance to Old Hades' cry</span><br>
<span class="line">Who beckons us to chase our high</span><br>
<span class="line">His cavelings squirm through cracks to join us</span><br>
<span class="line">Sweet smoke consumes our rowdy chorus</span><br>
<span class="line">And so we played as spirits fused</span><br>
<span class="line">Unified, with stamina imbued</span><br>
<span class="line">We’ll party on ‘til liquid rock arrives</span><br>
<span class="line">‘Til ash and friends should come alive…</span><br>
</p></div>
<div class="poem"><p><span class="line">…With might was dawn’s great geyser freed</span><br>
<span class="line">At that, our wine-dark punch bowl emptied</span><br>
<span class="line">Thus could raise one goblet all</span><br>
<span class="line">So that our tombstones may stand tall.</p></div>    </blockquote>
