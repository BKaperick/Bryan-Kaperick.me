<p><em>While in decline</em> &ndash; May 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The sun still shines while in decline<br>
And bees slave all their lives<br>
Sea waves collapse in foamy smacks<br>
And trees in hollow snaps.</p>
<p>A man may choose to honey bathe<br>
Or surf the lightningâ€™s strike<br>
But he like all must heed the call<br>
Of sunset on his back.</p>    </blockquote>
