<p><em>The tower</em> &ndash; February 2024</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>His eyes and Hers align to keep<br>
panoptic, periodic rhyme at sea<br>
and frothy mermen arms outreached<br>
for prey who slips away beneath<br>
the tower’s twin-turn stare.</p>
<p>Frustrated shadows lurk below<br>
for sheer is water as it flows<br>
firmly caught within the tow<br>
of Their revolving omniglow<br>
where washed-up mysteries lay bare.</p>
<p>Then one night the twin pair winked —<br>
Her brother fell from tower’s brink.<br>
Straight He dove and straight He’ll sink.<br>
Sister waterlogged by weeps,<br>
She cast Her duty off without a care.</p>
<p>Storms arise when rhythm’s lost,<br>
sirens shriek like albatross,<br>
long-drowned urchins shed their moss,<br>
nocturne barges glide across<br>
the purview of a watch in disrepair.</p>
<p>By dawn Her misery ossified.<br>
A corroded heart beats in half-time<br>
all while shadows grow twice as wide.<br>
Her mood now high and low like tide<br>
ever bound to the pull of out there.</p>    </blockquote>
