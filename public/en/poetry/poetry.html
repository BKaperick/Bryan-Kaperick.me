<p>I would categorize my personal style as somewhere between <em>derivative</em> and <em>cringe</em>.  Of course, I&rsquo;m open to all sorts of feedback.</p>

  Works that inspire me</h1>

<p><em>On First Looking into Chapman&rsquo;s Homer</em> &ndash; John Keats    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Much have I travell&rsquo;d in the realms of gold,<br>
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;<br>
Round many western islands have I been<br>
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.<br>
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br>
That deep-brow&rsquo;d Homer ruled as his demesne;<br>
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br>
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:<br>
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br>
When a new planet swims into his ken;<br>
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br>
He star&rsquo;d at the Pacific—and all his men<br>
Look&rsquo;d at each other with a wild surmise—<br>
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Kubla Khan</em> &ndash; Samuel Taylor Coleridge    <em><br /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, a vision in a dream.  A Fragment.</em></p></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
Through caverns measureless to man<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Down to a sunless sea.<br>
So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</p>
<p>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:<br>
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br>
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Floated midway on the waves;<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;From the fountain and the caves.<br>
It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</p>
<p>   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;In a vision once I saw:<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;It was an Abyssinian maid<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Could I revive within me<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Her symphony and song,<br>
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;To such a deep delight ’twould win me,<br>
That with music loud and long,<br>
I would build that dome in air,<br>
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
And all who heard should see them there,<br>
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
And close your eyes with holy dread<br>
For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>Compliment</em> &ndash; John Updike    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We were both of two minds about adultery<br>
and wasted our couple of stolen hours<br>
half-undressed in the Afternoon Motel<br>
kissing and drinking and doubting and forgoing.<br>
She had never betrayed her husband before.<br>
I said, &ldquo;O.K., so don&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s not.  This has been<br>
a lot of fun in any case.&rdquo;<br>
But something inquisitive in her, in Eve,<br>
would not move back from the brink,<br>
and after the longest, gentlest time lying<br>
side by side on the still-intact rented bed<br>
(I admiring her upper lip while it twitched<br>
in well-phrased trepidation, time running out),<br>
there was a surge as in a written exam<br>
when the answer had suddenly come to her;<br>
we completed the half left un- (see above),<br>
and the shy sea-creature of her ferny pubic hair<br>
gave me something else to admire, and<br>
a new aroma to activate my briny deeps.<br>
She was sweetly tight but not dry, not quite<br>
a virgin.  &ldquo;O.K.?&rdquo; I asked, half guilty,<br>
glancing over at her proximate profile.<br>
Tremulous eyelids nervily closed upon<br>
a dreaming vision of the fallen world&rsquo;s dooms,<br>
and all the web of her sensation bent<br>
to hold the pulsing bulk of this new captive,<br>
she breathed the single smiling word &ldquo;Terrific.&rdquo;</p>    </blockquote>

<p><em>People at Night</em> &ndash; Rainer Maria Rilke    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Nights were not made for the crowds, and they sever<br>
You from your neighbor, so you shall never<br>
Seek him, defiantly, at night.<br>
But if you make your dark house light,<br>
To look on strangers in your room,<br>
You must reflect—on whom.</p>
<p>False lights that on men&rsquo;s faces play<br>
Distort them gruesomely.<br>
You look upon a disarray,<br>
A world that seems to reel and sway,<br>
A waving, glittering sea.<br>
On their foreheads gleams a yellow shine<br>
Where thoughts are chased away.<br>
Their glances flicker mad from wine,<br>
And to the words they say<br>
Strange heavy gestures make reply,<br>
That struggle in the buzzing room;<br>
And they say always, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo;;<br>
And mean—they know not whom.</p>    </blockquote></details>
